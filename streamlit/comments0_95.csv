In time, we replaced I believe six retaining walls. Retaining walls were very expensive. Most builders don't build them.

6,I only ever did the calculations for one retaining wall and I used Reynolds text book to do my calculations.  As I still understand it the thickness depends on the 'angle of repose' of the material being retained (in my case sand) and the overturning moment due to the height.  I was shocked to find the wall was to be 4ft thick at the base.  I got my calculations checked by a Professor of Civil Engineering and he told me I was spot on.  The guy I was doing the drawings for (a garage cut into an embankment with another persons house near the top of it) decided it was all rubbish and cut the ground away to build without the retaining wall.  I withdrew from the job only to read about 5 months later as the ground dried out the land had slipped damaging to the the new garage and the other persons house.  The idiot went ahead without local authority consent.  It cost the guy big time as his insurance would not pay and his neighbours insurance also went after him.  Not only that he was sued for damages uncivil court and also fined for unauthorised development.

The house has a paved terrace out front with a timber retaining wall at one end, which was starting to collapse.

They had built a temporary wall while excavating held up with dirt nails, but while doing that, they unearthed a shipyard (including a complete whaler!) and had to call in historians and archeologists to better preserve what they found. Because of this, the retaining wall on half the site wound up starting to fail, effecting the basement of the building across the street. All equipment was removed from the top of the hole while they figured out what to do, eventually going with longer dirt nails and restarted that half.

A couple of years ago I built a patio in our back garden, and because it was on a slope, I ended up having to build a six brick high retaining wall at one end. I've never done anything like this before, so I just laid some concrete footings and built the wall!  (Back filling with soil.) I did include a few drainage holes to stop water building up, and laid the wall double, with more substantial footings (the rest of the patio base was single brick) - and of course the ends of the wall are 'tied' into the two side walls. But I did all this by gut instinct - without any real understanding of what I was doing. After all, it was only a patio!

85,"Talking about retaining walls. Have you seen the ones used by Medieval Japan? In my opinion, it's really incredible how structurally durable & aesthetically pleasing they are despite being really simple by nature. Good examples of the use of such retaining walls would be how they're used in the raised ramparts of Japanese castles. It's worth checking out if you're curious, particularly how they're constructed. Last year, the NHK made a documentary exploring such a thing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9wGOXXoCuY ) the building featured is the Rolex Service Centre in Dallas, Texas. It's shown in the video that the traditional wall construction method has remained relatively unchanged over the centuries, and is highly labor-intensive, but if done correctly, produces little to no waste.

It had a big advantage for our town, as that area was still usable during most of the construction works.

130,"In my neighborhood, the subway system is in the phase of underground extension.
To build one of the underground stations the engineers seem to have used a technique not mentioned here 
(unless I have understood nothing in the explanations, however very clear).
Before starting the excavation they dug  the location of all the retaining walls surrounding the pit 
(~ 10 m X 10 m and ~ 15 m depth) by flooding the trenches during digging to avoid their collapse.

Once all the trenches were dug, they replaced the water, drowning the trenches, with concrete thus forming the retaining walls (there must surely be reinforcing bars but I did not see them). 
it is from the moment when the concrete has been completely dry that they excavated the zone delimited by these exterior walls.",peronik,0,2021-12-10T13:40:46Z,0,"0    in my neighborhood the subway system is in the...

In the final analysis, non transportation platforms may be allowed to slowly erode via weep holes, while road and rail foundations must be robustly supported and the underlying material be effectively drained at all times without significant erosion. Obviously I have added nothing to the understanding of any soil scientist or hydrologist ( which my oldest son ended up as a master's degreed and consummate master of professionally).

83,"Season 5 part 2 was phenomenal. Im at a loss of words, this whole season was such an emotional rollercoaster. I laughed, cried, got annoyed, felt every human emotion ever. Part A focussed more on Deckerstar, But in Part B, other important relationships and meetings were highlighted. It is the best season ever! Lucifer is by far, the best series i have ever watched. The humour, characterization, plotlines, all appealed to me, but most importantly, As lucifer morningstar evolved in the course of the series, I evolved too. Lucifer is not just a show to me, its a journey I lived to find out more about myself. I could relate to Lucifer on several counts. He made a breakthrough in one of his therapy sessions that he hated himself. I hated myself too. He blamed himself for the sins that humanity commited though he has no control over it. I blamed myself for the sins I committed that I have no control over now. He thinks that he is incapable of love, not worthy of Chloe's love, which is exactly how i felt about myself too, unworthy of the love of my loved ones, and completely useless. But seeing Lucifer from a third person POV, you realise how Lucifer is the only one worthy of Chloe's love because of the lengths he would go to protect her, how he is precious to everyone he loves, Amenadiel, Charlie, Linda, Maze, Trixie and even Dan, he loves all of them wholeheartedly and would readily sacrifice himself for them. I too am worthy of the love I get, I am precious to the people around me. We underestimate ourselves just like Lucifer when it comes to loving ourself and others. Lucifer's devil face is a result of how he sees himself as, an embodiment of evil, and Lucifer is anything but evil. He had been misunderstood since the beginning of time and had been portrayed evil and malicious in holy texts. I too, saw myself as the Devil. But when Lucifer forgave himself and let go of his guilt, his devil face and wings receded. I realised I must forgive myself too for being so harsh on myself and feeling guilty for all the sins i committed. That I deserve some self love to bring out the angel that resides within the devil in me. Lucifer gave me hope that I can be a better person than I am, that I can change for the better. He taught me to always tell the truth no matter how bitter it is.Ella taught me how everyone has darkness in them, and it is important to accept it and let the brightness in us shine. Because the darker the darkness, the brighter the light. She also taught me to have faith in the big guy even in hopeless times. Maze taught me how love can make you weak but also more stronger than you think. Amenadiel taught me to look at everything from a positive, unique perspective. Linda taught me to confront my emotions and admit them, rather than trying to conceal them. Dan thought me how life can pull you down, but its upto you whether you choose to stay down or pull yourself up. Chloe taught me to believe in myself and my capabilities no matter how hard people try to make me doubt them. God taught me how nothing lasts forever. Trixie taught me to be optimistic in the darkest of times. Every character in Lucifer teaches an important lesson. This series made me wanna be a better person, and that says a lot about it. Im proud to call myself a lucifan. I watched all 5 seasons with such enthusiasm that i cannot wait for season 6. I am disheartened that i completed watching the 5 seasons, and wont be able to watch anything new in lucifer for another year, i think. I thank the makers of lucifer for creating such a beautiful show. Lucifer has left a deep impact on me and helped shape me into a better person. I hope it changes you too❤️ 
P.S- Deckerstar redefine love in their own way. I hope we see a new phase of their relationship and life together as Mr. and Mrs. G and get a happily ever after.",doraemon lover,2,2021-06-03T17:22:21Z,0,"0    season 5 part 2 was phenomenal im at a loss of...

94,"Let's summarize COVID-19:

2010 - The first mentions of the coronavirus pandemic appear on the Rockefeller Foundation website

2012 - US National Intelligence Council report: by 2030, expect a new type of virus to reach every corner of the world

2014 - Research into corona virus mutation begins in a laboratory in North Carolina
The team leader is professor Ralph Baric and his assistant Lisa Gralinski, of Polish origin

2015 - a moratorium on this research is announced in the US, due to the risk to the world being too great if the strains get outside

2015 - Baric publishes a scientific work on the NATURE portal, where it presents the results of its research
A French professor reviewing this paper in Paris writes: the trajectory of this virus may be unpredictable

2016 - the project is transferred to the military
a laboratory in Wuhan, China, established in the context of a possible future biological warfare
Project leader Shi Zenghli, called BAD WOMAN, recognizes the ACE2 receptor, which is the same in bats and humans, so she can transmit natural animal coronaviruses to humans. Preferred direction of infection: human lungs - a quote from the research results
The pathogen is converted into a mutant biological weapon by adding to it by the human hand a so-called ""enhanced action function""

2016 - At the Detroit airport, the FBI stops a Chinese scientist carrying MERS and SARS samples

2017 - Piotr Czumakhow, Russian microbiologist says that things are ""absolutely crazy"" in Wuhan
Dr Fauci talks about a surprising disease during Trump's current tenure in a lecture at Georgetown University

2018 - first simulations of a future pandemic

2019 - October - the Event201 conference in New York and a precise scenario of the development of the coronavirus epidemic (talks are being held on how to manipulate the media and how to censor the ""hostile"" narrative "")

2020 - the project is implemented, although the virus is twice less contagious, it kills relatively rarely

03.2020 Bill Gates tries to force WHO to declare a pandemic - WHO does not want to do this

14.03 Bill Gates donates 50 million dollars to WHO

03/15 WHO declares a pandemic state (this state allows the introduction of drugs and vaccines without safety testing - what is the real purpose of vaccination?)  

The world stopped on the basis of a computer simulation suggesting that 100 million people would die.
According to computer models, the same company no longer has glaciers in Antarctica.

COVID-19 replaces all other diseases

Data manipulation is at its apogee. Data is not collated, it is only shown selectively.

The RT PCR test used shows false in even 8 out of 10 cases. The CDC says that even if the test is positive and you have symptoms, it doesn't mean you have the virus.

No laboratory in the world has a complete picture of the virus genome. Accordingly, what is being tested and what the vaccine is supposed to work against.

The facts are slowly starting to form a mosaic

Hospitals get several times more money for a patient with covid diagnosis and an additional bonus for connecting to a ventilator

Censorship is in full swing. People who speak differently from governments and the mainstream media are removed. Scientists and doctors, not to mention ordinary people, are ridiculed and muted.

There is information that ""covid-19"" is included in all those who died in hospitals. No matter what the patient really died of.

Only the hospital dies of covid - no data on those who died outside the hospital.

The virus is just a tool, the targets are different

Governments are walking on the belt of behind-the-scenes power operating by corrupting the worlds of science, media, politics and medicine

Following the fait accompli method - after four months of the pandemic, the virus itself has killed no more people than the seasonal flu, while the psychosis generated around the case has a real destructive power

The scenario is perfectly executed

The scale of unprecedented social surveillance is growing

COVID-19 becomes the perfect weapon.

Virtually anything can be done under his pretext

It gives insight to the moments we never knew about before. I also never knew that Selena had so many different hairstyles and experimented so much on her look. I also think it's cool they are using Selena's actual voice, it's great they are staying true to that. However, I feel like the casting, specifically for Selena, is off. I get that not even JLo herself looked much like selena but at least she was able to dance like her and bring out her charisma. They could've hired someone who looked more like the actual Selena and also had her curves.

The character Abraham looks a lot more authentic on this show.  He's bossy, controlling and really overbearing at times....I TOTALLY believe that's how he is in real life!😂

And poor A.B....he's so stressed out.  There's so much pressure placed on him to keep coming up with new songs all the time....he looks like he's about to burn out!

Her Father reminds me of Papa Joe Jackson, without the physical abuse. Not letting anything get in the way of their goals.  Now, I understand a lot more. AB had a lot on his shoulders. It was her Father who put her killer in her path, which I’m certain he regrets every second, but he didn’t know. Let’s enjoy this and anticipate Part II. All the actors/actresses did a wonderful job!

104,"I am very surprised by the over all feedback everywhere for this show. About a handful of points do I ever really agree with - 1. Wigs! 2. Needs more Selena. 3. Should have been called Selena y Los Dinos or the Quintanilla Family.

 I've been sitting and wondering what show some people have been claiming to watch because I found Christian incredibly charming in this role (with what they gave her thus far). And I enjoyed the expanded story that featured more of the behind the scenes of Selena's story. As in AB's struggles, and Suzettes story of trying not to be completely overshadowed by the over all ideal of SELENA. And Chris - yes, even Chris I found a little more interesting this time around. I believed those crazy kids were feeling awkward about their feelings and having to have to hide their relationship at such an odd and young pivotal point of their lives. Selena the film will always be seen in higher regards of course, but the series has me feeling some other sort of way by exploring the characters youths more. Sometimes, watching the film, I forget how young Selena truly was - and how young and naïve things had actually been for the family as a whole starting this crazy, though beautiful, Mexican-American dream.

The show isn't perfect. Budget seemed to have been thin at times. But I genuinely felt that heart had been considered and used for the making of the series. And I don't know if the hate is purely genuine, and I'm missing something others seem to see - or if perhaps people are too harsh these days and are only holding the 1997 film as Gospel.",Nicholas Andrade,3,2020-12-07T19:53:01Z,0,"0    i am very surprised by the over all feedback e...

120,"I’m so sad this series got a lot of bad reviews just because some people were expecting too much and being negative about it. Thinking the family is just milking money from Selena and comparing it to the movie. I think the main purpose of this series was to keep her relevant and get to know more about Selena and her family’s journey. Despite Christian does not resemble Selena, I understand why they cast her because she just has the same likeable vibe that Selena carries. I've been watching her since her Nickelodeon days ( Ned’s declassified school survival guide) until her series in Walking Dead. 

It upsets me that people remember her because she got shot (by that bruja Yolanda) and Jlo played her part. I read some comments that this series should have been in American Crime Story.",Ana Garcia,1,2020-12-19T18:32:12Z,0,"0    im so sad this series got a lot of bad reviews...

129,"If it wasn't for the money hungry male family members in the Quintanilla family, I would be SOOOOOO excited over this. My adoration and admiration of Selena has remained the same since I was a kid in the early 90s. I don't think I've ever idolized an artist since her death but the men in her family have just sucked away the joy I get when I see her getting popular. Because if she gets popular, that means more of her music is going to sell, and that only means that Abraham and AB will only get richer. I refuse to buy any of her music and/or stream it--I still have her old CDs and that's how I listen to her. All of that money go to those gross individuals and it sickens me. I want to watch this mini series but since both of those men are going to majorly profit out of it, I likely won't tune in.",AdriGoddess,0,2020-10-31T22:56:22Z,0,"0    if it wasnt for the money hungry male family m...

136,"Love Selena but why are they make it seem like she loved singing and wanted to become a singer since she was a little girl? There’s so many interviews of her talking about how much she hated singing and practicing as a little girl. Her real dream was to be a fashion designer, that was her real dream!!! And her family didn’t support her. They didn’t even attend the opening of her boutiques!!! Smh

We will never see the real story of Selena as long as abraham is alive. Yes Selena was a humble and sweet person but she also has a wild side and Chris her husband is the only one who can tell us that

Also a lot of the scenes shown on this trailer look like they were just copied and pasted from the movie!! Selena lived 23 years and she did so many things like common show us something new!!",Ivn Lps,863,2020-10-28T05:25:13Z,20,"0    love selena but why are they make it seem like...

Selena had no autonomy! She had to get married secretly! Think about that!

Apparently, Guadalupe Esparza from the ""Bronco"" band (who worked with her on ""Dos Mujeres, un Camino"" a soap opera) said that Selena was very controlled by her father, so much so that Selena was always stressed and couldn't be herself...

51,"Most badass girl songs are about how girls dont need men or love this, love that- (dont get me wrong I love that concept and jam out to songs like that too) but I love how this is just about pure girl power.  In kpop I believe- the first of its kind, a bop too! I really hope this becomes a hit and reaches girls all over the world so togther we can all become pirates! I also loved how weach member had this special badass trait about them that was different so, when girls see this they know to be awesome and a badass, you dont all have to be the same type of baddie! You can be different ant there's space for all of you! So Everglow fighting! And lets try to reach the top with this song! 
<3
edit:
as a female, I didn't mean to say that songs about not needing men are bad or invalid, I just meant to say that I really like how this song is purely about girls being girls, and how I liked that. I'm so sorry if my words offended anyone, and if you want this comment to be deleted I will :). I really didn't mean to say that women not needing men songs are bad or not needed-  I  said that most girl-power songs are like that , and how I just liked how this one was purely about girls, no men thought about, no love or ex-lover. and, when i said first of its kind, I meant that its the first time I heard about a song like this! I'm sorry and I do understand that they are more songs like this.

20,"Having owned, and still own an SLS, I agree with Freddy about the shifts on the SLS. They were painfully slow from the factory.  BUT, there is a software update that any Mercedes dealership can perform.  Once you do the $200 software update, it's amazingly faster.  Even the tech at the dealership was shocked by the difference.  Get the update Tyler!





I can't believe the steel brakes on the SLS could be that bad.  I have the ceramics and they're insanely grippy.  I think the steel ones are the same diameter, just over 16 inches up front!  So there must be crap pads in that car.





Tyler, upgrade the interior with the factory carbon fiber.  It's so much better than the aluminum and you can find them for ~$3k.  It's sad the only CF in the car is that ugly steering wheel.  If you can find it, the carbon fiber engine bay is gorgeous.  But those are a needle in a haystack to find and people ask crazy money (~10k).",SOLYLUNASF,10,2021-09-16T07:53:38Z,0,"0    having owned and still own an sls i agree with...

It didn’t really hurt, but it just looked bad because of the blood. We had a sub that day who was a bit strict, and when I walked up to him he was talking with another student. I tried to interrupt him to tell him, and he said, “Are you on fire? Are you bleeding?” In a sarcastic tone, then said, “Then go back to your seat”, expecting me to have just wanted to ask a question that could wait. I mean, I was technically interrupting his conversation. I told him that I actually was bleeding and showed him, and he freaked right out lol. He took me to the bathroom and helped and showed me how to rinse it off with cold water and then apply pressure to stop it from bleeding before adding a band aid.

Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ? 

the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all
Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved 

Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity 

 God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins 

God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved 

the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins 

receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today 

John 3 
For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. 

This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned

. But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].””
‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭

For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.”
‭‭Romans 6.23

Reciprocating engines have had over 100 years of development by almost every car and motorcycle manufacturing company to get them to the high level of refinement they now enjoy. By comparison, the rotary has had  only a handful of companies even get to the point of building development mules, and only one has made a serious production engine. I've always wondered where we would be if the rotary had been invented first. Imagine trying to convince a rotary engine manufacturer that they need to replace their engine with something that had 100 times more parts and vibrated like a paint shaker.",Michael Parks,218,2021-11-28T17:47:58Z,81,"0    back in the 70s i had an artic cat snowmobile ...

26,"Definitely a fun engine design. I think a lot of people are drawn to it simply because it is different and unique.
I had a couple of first generation rx7s. Actually they were relatively reliable. Never had any significant problems with him and both of them went past 150,000 miles. 
I think the 13B with fuel injection was probably the sweet spot on the engine. Fuel injection made it run a lot better, but yet was still early enough that emissions regulations weren't causing problems. Not long after that I think it just became a lost cause. There was no way you were going to get that thing to pass stricter emissions regulations. Without significantly increasing the complexity which kind of defeats the purpose.
At the same time reciprocating piston designs got better and better forced induction increase the power to displacement ratio. And it kind of became pointless.
I do think there is a definite place for rotaries. People have mentioned possible generators for hybrids. They do work very well for stationary power and constant RPM.",kens97sto171,135,2021-11-29T07:25:49Z,29,"0    definitely a fun engine design i think a lot o...

31,"The Wankel and it's many derivatives fail vs the conventional piston engine because of its very inefficient combustion chamber. It's cursed with a large wetted area to volume ratio so the heat of combustion is soaked up by the sides of the chamber instead of doing work. The best shape for efficient combustion would be a sphere which, of course, has the most volume to surface area. Nobody has yet figured out how to couple mechanical energy out of a sphere so we are stuck with the second best shape: the cylinder. The Wankel has good mechanical efficiency (but so does a two-stroke piston engine). The Wankel excels at getting a lot of hp out of a small size but that trochoidal combustion chamber makes it uncompetitive with piston engines whenever fuel efficiency counts.",Jay _,112,2021-11-28T16:51:22Z,9,"0    the wankel and its many derivatives fail vs th...

Really interesting story on Wankel bikes, while this certainly doesn't sound like the best execution the idea still sounds doomed. People have been trying for most of a century to make practical rotary engines, but so far they've never been more than novelties or useful in very niche applications. Worst case I've heard of was when someone put a Mazda rotary in an RV-8 small airplane.

107,"I actually owned and rode the Wankel made by Suzuki, the RE-5, meaning 500 cc. It was red and had the weird cylindrical instrument cluster and spherical turn signals, all thanks to Italian design firm Peninfarina. The SECOND year Suzuki sold their RE-5, all were painted black and they had normal instruments and turn signals. They still did not sell well. I got my red one for half price at the dealership, when it was a year old _demo model_ with 498 miles on it. I kept it completely stock, except I added a full fairing. That made it a joy to ride, even for long distances like 500 miles in a single day. It was perfectly comfortable cruising at 80 mph, with no numbing vibration in the handlebars or footpegs and no buffeting by the wind. It also had enormous torque, even at low rpm. There was no need to slip the clutch for a quick getaway, just crank the throttle and simultaneously dump the clutch. It went 0-to-30 mph in the width of a 2-lane intersection, barely laying rubber, with no tire squeal. For the first half of a city block, it was quicker than the screaming, clutch-frying 1100 cc piston ""superbikes"", despite the rather hefty weight the RE-5 had and the rather tall gearing. (It would go 50 mph in 1st gear, 80 in 2nd, and 115 mph in 3rd gear.) In highway riding at 55 mph with my friend on his 1200 cc Harley, I would challenge him to pick any gear, while I would stay in 5th gear as we simultaneously rolled on the throttles. I never failed to outpace him by a comfortable margin, despite my being in 5th gear, amounting to _second overdrive._ The only major downside of the RE-5, in my opinion, was the poor fuel economy. It got as little as 12 miles per gallon while riding it 3 miles to work, in the winter, with choke on the whole time because it took that long to warm up.",YodaWhat,3,2021-12-08T18:03:03Z,2,"0    i actually owned and rode the wankel made by s...

25,"I worked for wish as a CSR, around 2016 - 2019. around 2017 they still have a product moderator that actually checks for these scummy postings by merchants. However, suddenly Wish decided to remove the moderating team and that is the time when the behavior of the merchants started to get worsen. However, back then merchants will not get their money not until the user confirmed his/her purchase has been delivered. However, not all of the users actually spend time dealing with customer service, and these asshole merchants getaways from some of this scam. I really think Wish is a sinking ship and I am surprised that they are still in the business. People stop buying shit at Wish you won't get any decent value out of any tech that you would find on their website. But the clothes and other things you could get lucky, but not with tech.

7,"""This position, this timing, this angle"".

Kageyama used these exact words when he first set the attack for Hinata. I love the parallels that Haikyuu is drawing. First of all, against Aoba Johsai, the first time, they essentially ""won the battle but lost the war"" - Kageyama successfully predicted that Iwaizumi was going to get the set from Oikawa, and they won the second set, but Kageyama became predictable himself when he set to Hinata and was blocked. This moment echoes that because Atsumu, wanting the point desperately, wished to use the speed of his quick with Atsumu to score...but in turn was blocked by Kageyama and Hinata, the only two that could react in time to a spike they were so familiar with. Speed is a weapon, but also a curse. People like Nekoma's Inuoka, and even Tsukishima back when the twins first copied it could shut it down because they had time to adapt to it.

14,"God, this scene is actual perfection. It shows all of the growth throughout the show. The synchronized attack, an attack where everyone works together and just trusts that the ball is going to them, and Tanaka being the one to spike it after being mentally torn down in this match. After it gets blocked, Tsukishima, Mr. It’s-just-a-club himself, is the one who chases the ball to the end of the court, tapping it just before it is able to fall to the ground. Then Daichi once again being the most reliable teammate, showing us he is the captain for a reason, getting the ball back onto the court. Then comes one of my favorite parts, where Yahaba hits the table yelling for them to go back, this doesn’t only show us that the rivals are rooting for them, but how memorable Karasuno has become, they were nothing, just clipped crows and barely remembered by the other teams, but now one of their biggest rivals are the ones rooting for them. THEN the twins quick, where they use Kageyama’s line from the first freak duo quick, but Kageyama and Hinata block it, the rival quick team is being blocked by the freak quick team. Kageyama, the one who rather do everything by himself and Hinata who only cares about spiking, working together to take down their own attack, GROWTH AMIRIGHT!! But that’s not all, we see the ball, reflected in Kita’s eyes, hitting the ground. Kita, the captain, who has only ever played in third year, the one trusted with every loose ball, his eyes are the ones we see Inarizaki’s defeat through.

15,"1:51 Can we all appreciate that the music in this scene has the same leitmotif as the OST ""Above"" (plays when Hinata makes his declaration to defeat Ushiwaka) and ""Battle of Concepts"", the latter being same theme used in the final rally against Shiratorizawa. Yes, the ""Twins Quick Minus Tempo Back"" absolutely rules, yes the ""This position...this timing...this angle"" absolutely rules, yes the ""We Don't Need The Memories"" absolutely rules, yes the double Hinata and Kageyama block absolutely rules, yes Hinata and Kageyama clinching the win against Inarizaki in the exact same way Aoba Johsai defeated them (by blocking the quick) absolutely rules, but ALL OF THAT combined AND the music having that recurring leitmotif, it just, dare I say

That just tells you that Hinata in that moment was the only calm/chill one because the hit was on purpose he was only to be able to take a sec and look at his surroundings and make that decision. 2) Tuski and Daichi’s receive like that just self explanatory 3) That teamwork block of Kageyama and Hinata I just loved how it wasn’t just they both jumped and it hit one person’s hand and went back but they both touched it and threw it back. 4) Tsukki realizing that in that last second that Hinata and Kageyama were the only ones that weren’t fazed and had enough strength in them to block the twins.

52,"BTS vino de una pequeña empresa, empezaron sin nada.
Jin, quien fue expulsado solo por su apariencia, Suga, quien dejó a su familia y apostó su educación solo para hacer lo que realmente quería ser,
Namjoon que nunca fue apoyado por sus padres,
Jimin que se creía feo y gordo,
Taehyung que siempre formó parte de BTS pero nunca se mostró en ninguna promoción, no hasta el debut,
Hoseok, que siempre parecía reír, pero nunca se sintió como un logro para su padre y Jungkook, quien era muy tímido y había salvado a sus padres a temprana edad mediante una audición a empresas.
¿Recuerdas los días en que estaban luchando?
¿Incluso tuvieron que sacrificarse y trabajar duro para poder comer?
Se estaban apretando en un pequeño apartamento y tuvieron que asumir responsabilidades, la razón por la que escribieron la canción ""move""

Esos momentos en que Jimin tiene que morirse de hambre solo porque la gente lo llama gordo y feo.
Esa entrevista donde Yoongi dijo eso; fue agradable que la gente escuchara su música porque Taehyung y Jungkook son guapos.
Y pensó que al menos era suficiente. ¿Te acuerdas de cuando se suponía que Hoseok era el vocalista y Taehyung el rapero, pero en su lugar eligió el rap y aprenderlo porque Taehyung quería ser el vocalista?
Era el sueño de Taehyungs y Hoseok ama su dongsaeng que tanto sacrificaría.

Otros fanáticos los acusaban de plagio solo porque tenían el más mínimo detalle, lo mismo con otros grandes grupos de Kpop, que en realidad era solo una coincidencia.
Hubo un momento en que Yoongi empacó 300 regalos y cartas solo para darles a sus 300 fanáticos que asistirán a sus mini reuniones de fanáticos.
Entonces, ¿por qué las personas los juzgan tan rápido?
¿Sabías que Jimin llegó hasta Seúl desde Busan solo para perseguir sus sueños?
¿Sabías que Taehyung vivió con su abuela durante casi la mitad de su vida haciéndolo inocente de todo lo que hay en nuestro mundo?
¿Sabías que Jungkook dejó de lado su vergüenza solo para satisfacer las expectativas del otro?
Sí, él es el maknae Dorado, pero también sufre cuando ve que sus hyungs están teniendo dificultades, llora.
Y hubo un momento en que Jimin lo atrapó llorando y la razón fue porque extrañaba a su familia.
Jungkook a menudo llora en secreto para que sus hyungs no se preocupen.
¿Sabías que Jin hizo una audición para hacer que su madre se enorgulleciera de él y para que su madre tuviera algo de qué presumir ante esos vecinos críticos que tenían?
Trabajó duro en su voz, pero la gente lo llamó sin talento.
¿Sabías que Namjoon trabajó duro solo para producir canciones pero hubo un momento en que su madre arruinó su computadora y rompió su micrófono para que pudiera concentrarse en estudiar?
¿Sabías que Hoseok audicionó porque quería que su padre estuviera orgulloso de él?
¿Porque sintió que era una decepción?

Esos días de novatos en los que solo escucharon los premios y se sorprendieron de sus mayores.
No pudieron hacer nada más que observar a los ídolos que recibieron los premios.
Estaban contentos.
Y ahora llegaron a la cima y se volvieron más exitosos. De 150 aficionados a 6mil y contando,
De una pequeña sala de práctica a una más grande.
Desde un dormitorio estrecho con compañeros de cuarto a un dormitorio grande, cada uno de ellos era un cuarto,
Desde un premio Daesang hasta más premios e incluso han ganado en BBMA.
BTS nunca esperó esto antes de su cuarto año de aniversario, han llegado tan lejos, hasta el momento que la única posibilidad que tenemos de verlos es ir a su concierto (NUNCA)
Encuéntralos en la calle con un 0.01% de probabilidad.
Pero realmente ARMYs !! ¡Hemos llegado hasta aquí, queridos, amémoslos y brindémosles nuestro apoyo hasta el final!
Quería agradecerles a todos. Te amo BTS! Permanezcamos juntos hasta el final. Si crees en lo que he dicho. Si crees en 1! 2! 3! 💜🥰",Madisson Esparza,630,2021-03-09T21:24:23Z,33,"0    bts vino de una pequea empresa empezaron sin n...

I cry now ... and cry a cry I have never cried like him in my life because of the amount of feelings in this album..Bangtan always makes us cry out of joy, from happiness and sometimes from sadness ... But now..Now..i  I cry because the warmth and tenderness of the album and the song made me feel very strange..no..I cannot know what this feeling is..It makes me in a state of sadness, happiness, panic, the desire to laugh and the desire to cry ... It always gives us very beautiful feelings ..  And what you felt about this album specifically is completely different from any album and any song previously..It really ... really makes you feel a warmth and a very beautiful feeling like the feeling of your mother’s embrace of you or the warmth of your family..woooo .... This year a lot of things have happened and most of them  Sadness and events at all that we did not expect in 2020 ... it was a really crazy year! ... But this album, the songs in it, its lyrics, its melody, the beauty of its meanings and its feeling ... made me feel that this year was more than exhausting, sad and very strange..but we had Bangtan  As medicine for all of these things ... When they encourage us when they make us happy, make us laugh, or make us laugh, or make us laugh, and tell us everything will be fine and fine .. and b  Stay with us all this year in order not to be sad or exhausted in it too much ... Bangtan I don’t know how to do that..how to make us cry and laugh and grieve at the same time .. Oh, you really ... you really make me believe that we are all here to love and  We are happy, cry, mourn and happy together, not just by ourselves!  .... .. I cannot write because I am crying now and my eyes are shedding tears strongly..that is why I will say that we love you so much, we love what you make for us, we love that you care about what we love and what we want .... and you care about our grief and relieve our pain ... and you care about words and how you want them  To reach us..we love you and we will love you forever .... you are life and happiness for us..we love you very, very much..and as you please us, we will return the favor to you too..so wait ... we love you so much ...

I want them to heal from it and find the courage to move forward again.

52,"10 of the World's Best and Funniest One Liners

1. The hardness of butter is directly proportional to the softness of the bread.
2. The last thing on earth you want to do will be the last thing you do.
3. Eschew obfuscation.
4. They told me I was gullible...and I believed them.
5. I just let my mind wander, and it didn't come back. 
6. Don't steal. The government hates competition.
7. The word ""gullible"" isn't in the dictionary.
8. Honk if you like peace and quiet.
9. The Big Bang Theory: God Spoke and BANG! it happened. 
10. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.


        Editorial:            Probably the most thought-provoking 
one-liner is ""Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway."" It's sad but true -- no 
matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned 
against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? 
Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, ""Whoever looks upon a woman to lust 
after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart."" Ever 
looked with lust? If you have said ""Yes"" to these three questions, by 
your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and 
we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on 
Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be 
guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for
 you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: ""God 
commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ
 died for us."" Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God 
promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their 
sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not 
have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the 
Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.",egymario,0,2021-04-10T15:36:04Z,0,"0    10 of the worlds best and funniest one liners1...

53,"This song makes me feel sad. Anyone who has followed your journey from the beginning knows that you never sold out. If they fucked with you in the beginning, they should understand that you are a work in progress. We all are.

Hating because you gained success is not being a real fan. You still speak nothing but truth. Not wanting you to come up is being hateful. I do think a lot of us hope you stay independent so that you can stay true to yourself, but being able to support your family and take care of yourself is not selling out. That's just fake fans and jealous people. If they really cared, they'd be thrilled to see you doing well.

Hoping someone stays in their struggles is a shitty way to be. Keep up the grind and I hope you are happier now than you were when things were at their lowest. You have helped so many of us. I believe you rose and took a lot of us with you. Thank you. 💙",bellabilliebaby [formerly LB the Bunz],53,2020-11-20T17:11:33Z,1,"0    this song makes me feel sad anyone who has fol...

Credit to John Henry for doing this, however, I feel he will need to do a lot more if he wants to get the fans back on board.

Meetings that obviously were done behind the backs of the fans and other people at the clubs.

2. Unlike his decision to join the Super League, the apology was made in public by himself. I appreciate that.
3. His words make his intentions clear, he's not leaving. He wants to mend the fractured relationships not just with the fans, but with Jurgen too.

I believe he's done enough to earn one last chance at rectifying the mess he's created and rebuild the relationships at the club.

Fingers crossed the Mercedes engine is robust enough to cope with the mode used to get pole.

59,"To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message 

Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ? 

the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all
Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved 

Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity 

 God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins 

God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved 

the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins 

receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today 

John 3 
For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. 

This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned

. But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].””
‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭

For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.”
‭‭Romans 6.23

60,"Strangely after contracting and fighting off COVID, my near anosmia (I’ve been relatively unable to smell things for at least a decade, with a few inconsistent exceptions) and spice tolerance have noticeably improved, without a noticeable deterioration in my ability to taste (I never lost my sense of taste during COVID, though smell remains uncertain given my near anosmia). 

For those curious my symptoms were as followed: 
*A Low Grade Fever: Strangely it never reached the health department’s temperature classification. 
*Backed Up Sinuses: It eventually reached a point where I could feel an acidic burning in my nostrils. (Definitely the most miserable symptom)
*General Body Aches: A typical symptom whenever I get a bad infection or cold.

1. The spike does not consist of one spike protein only but comprises three identical, intertwined spike proteins.

2.

""Particles are more or less rounded in profile; although there is a certain amount of polymorphism, there is also a characteristic ""fringe"" of projections 200 A long, which are rounded or petal shaped, rather than sharp or pointed, as in the myxoviruses.

Once the protein spike is replicated in your body, how does your immune system come to recognize the spike as a foreign entity to target and destroy?  Does the protein spike cause damage to any of your cells/body in order to provoke the immune response?
Which of your cells are host to the mRNA and resultant protein spikes?  Do those cells go on producing the spikes as long as they live?  Could this cause problems in certain cell types such as nerves or eggs where the cell is never replaced and  expected to live as long as you do?

22,"Losing weight and staying in shape has little to do with age. However I will admit it does get more difficult as you age but it all comes down to lifestyle and state of mind. People who blame covid for weight gain are shifting the focus off their poor choices. I am 43 years old and was pushing 200 lbs going into covid. Simple things were beginning to get difficult for me to do. Granted, 200lbs is not seriously obese, but I didn’t mention that I am only 5’7”. 

I decided to do something about it. I started off simple, only changing my diet to start with. Making healthy choices, making sure not to eat a few hours before going to sleep, reducing portion sizes. I did NOT count calories, just eating healthier things. I lost 15 lbs in about 2 months. I then began to do intermittent fasting, my fasts lasted anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. I would fast once about every week to a week and a half. Keep in mind, up until now I have not yet to increase my daily physical activity, just my eating habits. Fasting the first time was difficult because I did not know what to expect. Subsequent fasts were much easier. I encourage everyone to research the amazing health benefits of intermittent fasting, you will be amazed.

One key note on my experience with fasting. Before changing my diet to a more healthy diet, if I had gone an extended period of not eating due to being busy or what have you, for say 7 or 8 hours, I would get dizzy or feel light headed or a general feeling of weakness. I don’t know for a fact, but I believe it was some form of effects from low blood sugar. I assume this because I could eat a candy bar or a piece of fruit or just drink a “sugary” drink and it would almost immediately subside. So I was concerned with how fasting would go. Fortunately I suffered NONE of these symptoms during my first fast or any of my many fasts up to present. I attribute it to having changed my diet to a more healthy diet months prior to my first fast. I had already cut out most of the unhealthy processed sugars that I used to eat. No medical proof to back this up, just my experience.

I continued this for about 4 months. At this point eating healthy and intermittent fasting became a habit and easy to keep up with. I had lost another 10 lbs or so and my weight stabilized at a range of about 172 to 175lbs. As of about 3 weeks ago I have implemented weight lifting and yoga. I plan to begin cardio very soon. My target weight is between 165 and 170lbs. Small changes are the key.. small changes with consistency so they become habit, then another small change. 

I am so much happier when I look in the mirror, but the biggest satisfaction is from how good I feel. I feel rejuvenated, full of energy throughout the day, my clothes fit better and my body feels better. Anyone can do this, you just need to make a choice to do it, and it HAS to be for YOU, not for anyone else. Take the time to INVEST in yourself. I BELIEVE in YOU, so BELIEVE in yourself! I hope my story helps someone, you CAN do it.

Edit: I also wanted to add one more note about my experience with fasting. During my fasts, I surprisingly did not feel drained or weak at any time. Quite the opposite actually. I was taken aback by how energetic I felt during the whole process. The hardest thing at first was the hunger. It would hit hard at first, during the time periods where I would normally be having a meal. The hungry feeling would generally last about 10 to 15 minutes, then it would go away. This seemed to continue in cycles every few hours, especially if I was not actively doing something as in just sitting around watching tv and such. However I did notice that each cycle got weaker and weaker, meaning it was easier to cope with. Many times I could dampen it by chugging a bottle of water. I later found out that there is a chemical that your body releases that creates the hungry feeling, you should look that up too, its quite interesting. Now that I am used to it and understand what it is and why I’m feeling it, I have NO issues fasting, it gets too easy. I have actually done a few 48 hour fasts and could have gone longer but I had already pre-decided when I was going to end the fast.",J.

My life changed when I finally set my mind to the thinking that anything is possible if you decide so. I took a meal plan to start with. I created it on Nextlevel diet, which was super helpful at the time. I didn't have to worry about calories, macros, nutrients and all that stuff. I just focused on walking long distances and exercising after I got on a level where I could do some simple workouts. I hope my story will inspire you to do the same.

40,"As someone part of the healthcare industry, it frustrates me seeing the ending of this episode. The disappointment in the results a scale gives someone as it crushes their dreams of an accomplishing week. There are so many factors that can go into a 1lb gain that isn't discussed which could easily change the demeanour of this video and his journey of getting to his target weight. He could be feeing 100 times better than the start of the week, yet just because of that single number at the end, his mindset is crushed, which is how most of society will feel. I hope people will look at the intangibles of physical activity, rather than the straight up number, which could be misleading for the most part, because of muscle mass gain, or just literally what you ate or drank the night before, to being slightly more stressed at the end of the week.

96,"When society talks about health, the only measurement is weight and looks. But a healthy human can't be just measured by that. If you have a few extra pounds, but you feel great about who you are, and what you do and your mental health is in great shape, it's 10000% healthier for you. Mental health is an equally important factor we should always consider when getting in shape. How healthy are your relationships? Family, friends, work. Do you even have healthy relationships? Are you happy with what you are doing with your life? Is it fulfilling for yourself? Does the daily workout really make you happy or is it torture for you? You can buy a lot of things, but nobody can buy time. Once it's used, it's gone. So you better choose wisely.
