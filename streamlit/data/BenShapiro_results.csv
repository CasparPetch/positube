58,"What's even more damning is the electorate's apparent galactic ignorance of the Presidential Records Act. 

The Act affirms the President's sole and absolute authority to retain whatever records he wants without authorization from anyone in any way, shape, or form upon leaving the White House. This sole absolute authority can be (and has been) challenged over the years with the courts affirming this sole legal authority. For example, Bill Clinton was sued for retaining copies of recordings of national security meetings at his residence. The court dismissed the case - read that again ""dismissed"" the case - citing the PRA, which completely nullified the case against Clinton. Clinton did not ""steal"" anything - he retained what he wanted at his sole discretion as specifically prescribed and authorized by law.

Yet the MSM is deliberately suggesting that the one man with the sole absolute authority to retain whatever records he wanted by law did not have that authority and those with precisely zero authority in the matter (e.g., the administrative state) did have that authority. Stunning.
