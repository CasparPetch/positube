77510,"Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants.


Grass
The grasses include the ""grass"" of the family Poaceae. This family is also called Gramineae. The family also include some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[1] These three families are not closely related but all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a common life-style.

The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.

Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow very tall, such as Bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.

Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[2] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).",Neutral,5.8,72.99,21.21,0.15,0.15,1,SA5eW3UiRSM,ZHC

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express how much you inspire me. Your art pieces are simply breathtaking, and I have found myself lost in your videos and social media accounts for hours at a time.

You are truly my idol, and I aspire to create art as stunning as yours one day. Seeing your passion for your craft and your dedication to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with art has motivated me to keep pushing myself to improve my own skills.

I especially love your recent piece, the one where you transformed an ordinary car into a work of art. The attention to detail and the sheer creativity involved in that project left me speechless. Your ability to take an ordinary object and turn it into something extraordinary is truly awe-inspiring.

As someone who also loves to create art, your work has been a constant source of inspiration for me. Whenever I am feeling stuck or uninspired, I know I can turn to your videos and social media accounts for a boost of creativity.

Thank you for being such an amazing artist and sharing your work with the world. You have truly left an indelible mark on the art world, and I am grateful for the impact you have had on me personally.‚ù§üéâ‚ù§‚ù§üéâüéâ",Positive,0.18,1.04,98.78,0.99,4.95,5,SA5eW3UiRSM,ZHC

I'd give my heart to this place
I'd give my soul or whatever it takes, never run away
I've got enough angels to storm the gates, I'm not afraid
And behold the brave, not have it no other away

I miss the emergence and these moments of you
The mere reflection of me, that mirror can't change its view
So until those rivers run out, it runs through me
Wherever you are, I'll b–µ there
We carry on (w–µ carry on)
Born again

I'd give my heart to this place (I'd give my heart to this place)
I'd give my whole soul and whatever it takes, never run away
And I'd relive this just to see your face again
I know that you'd do the same, born again

Just tell me what I need to do
I'd die and come back just to love you

She wouldn't hear this masterpiece, but I will for her.  Rihanna is a reminder to me of my beloved cousin and the times we would jam listening to Riri's songs. ‚ú®  Thank you, Rihanna for your music.  I had a lot of memories to keep because of it. ‚ú® I can't wait to watch your Super Bowl performance. ‚ú®

(Yes, for those who didn't know yet, NFL announced last September that Riri is going to perform for Super Bowl 2023 - Halftime Show, Let's all wait and watch her perform üòä)

Edit: To the replies saying this is fake, I really do hope it is.  I hope it's a lie to wake up one Sunday morning and learn that your cousin who is more like a big sister to you is already gone and to those who replied why would I post this here? It's because I believe some people don't have anyone to talk to if they're grieving and people have different perspectives when listening to music.  This song touched my heart and reminded me of someone, that's why. Lying and getting attention are least of my concerns, it's not in my nature.  I would never lie and stoop so low just to get likes.  I actually didn't expect this to blow up but I realized a lot of people are going through/went through the same experience so maybe that's why. Maybe not all but to some people, times are tough so let's be kind to one another.  I just genuinely vented my feelings here.  I still do respect your opinion though since this is how socmed works: You post publicly, you get positive/negative replies so no bitter feelings for y'all. ‚ú® Still, I wish you no harm.

Thank you for those leaving nice comments and to those who also lost a loved one, I hope you all find comfort that you're never alone.  Please know that grieving has no timeline so your feelings are valid every time you get sad when remembering a deceased loved one.  Always keep in mind, that our loved ones know we love and remember them everyday. ‚ú®  They might be gone but they're alive in our hearts and memories. üòä",Positive,9.7,41.76,48.54,0.39,1.9500000000000002,5,Mx_OexsUI2M,Rihanna

She wouldn't hear this masterpiece, but I will for her.  Rihanna is a reminder to me of my beloved cousin and the times we would jam listening to Riri's songs. ‚ú®  Thank you, Rihanna for your music.  I had a lot of memories to keep because of it. ‚ú® I can't wait to watch your Super Bowl performance. ‚ú®

(Yes, for those who didn't know yet, NFL announced last September that Riri is going to perform for Super Bowl 2023 - Halftime Show, Let's all wait and watch her perform üòä)

Edit: To the replies saying this is fake, I really do hope it is.  I hope it's a lie to wake up one Sunday morning and learn that your cousin who is more like a big sister to you is already gone and to those who replied why would I post this here? It's because I believe some people don't have anyone to talk to if they're grieving and people have different perspectives when listening to music.  This song touched my heart and reminded me of someone, that's why. Lying and getting attention are least of my concerns, it's not in my nature.  I would never lie and stoop so low just to get likes.  I actually didn't expect this to blow up but I realized a lot of people are going through/went through the same experience so maybe that's why. Maybe not all but to some people, times are tough so let's be kind to one another.  I just genuinely vented my feelings here.  I still do respect your opinion though since this is how socmed works: You post publicly, you get positive/negative replies so no bitter feelings for y'all. ‚ú® Still, I wish you no harm.

Thank you for those leaving nice comments and to those who also lost a loved one, I hope you all find comfort that you're never alone.  Please know that grieving has no timeline so your feelings are valid every time you get sad when remembering a deceased loved one.  Always keep in mind, that our loved ones know we love and remember them everyday. ‚ú®  They might be gone but they're alive in our hearts and memories. üòä",Positive,9.7,41.76,48.54,0.39,1.9500000000000002,5,Mx_OexsUI2M,RihannaVEVO

[Verse 1]
I'd give my heart to this place
I'd give my soul or whatever it takes, never run away
I've got enough angels to storm the gates, I'm not afraid
And behold the brave, not have it no other away
I miss the emergence and these moments of you

Recuerdos que vienen  a mi mente
Al recordar mis primeros versos
de una ni√±ez llenos de alegr√≠a y de felicidad,
Corriendo por el patio grande 
De la casa de mi abuela
 
Tropezando y tropezando con aquellos naranjales, matas de lim√≥n y palos de guayabas
Y luego entrando sin detenerme a la cocina, sintiendo el olor dulce de los postres de ciruela hechos por mi abuela,
 
Recuerdos que vienen  a mi mente
Al recordar mis primeros versos
de una ni√±ez llenos de alegr√≠a y felicidad,
Corriendo por el patio grande 
de la casa de mi abuela
 
Aun recuerdo el trinar alegre de los libres pajaritos,
Jugando y volando entre las hojas de los matarratones,
y ver nacer  muchas mariposas de colores
para luego desplegar sus alas y alzar  sus vuelos 
buscando la serran√≠a, ‚ÄúAll√≠ te vi por vez primera se√±ora pobreza‚Äù
 
Mi sentir no entend√≠a porque mi abuela te llamaba se√±ora pobreza, 
solo porque la olla de la cocina siempre permanec√≠a vac√≠a, no hab√≠a ni pa un sancocho de gallina, ni un de arroz de liza, solo se hacia una buena olla de caf√© que regalaban en la serran√≠a, y siempre estaban  las risas y carcajadas de mis t√≠as.
 
D√≠game se√±ora pobreza porque la llaman as√≠, solo porque en la cocina de mi abuela la olla permanec√≠a vac√≠a, solo hab√≠a risas y carcajadas de mis t√≠as.
 
Deme usted la  mano se√±ora pobreza, para no sentirla dentro de mi
Ya me voy de estoy pueblo porque aun permanece vac√≠a la olla de mi abuela,
Todav√≠a  recuerdo las risas y carcajadas de mis t√≠as.
 
Adi√≥s se√±ora pobreza siga su camino que yo seguir√© el m√≠o,
Todav√≠a recuerdo las risas y carcajadas de mis t√≠as.
 

















BAILA MORENA.
 
Tu caminar moviendo tus alegres caderas
bailando y cantando con tu melodiosa voz 
ese  ritmo caribe√±o que llevan tus canciones 
que sabor llevas mujer caribe√±a con ese tumbao.
 
Baila morena, baila morena
con ese tumbao que solo 
lo hacen los movimientos 
de tus caderas
al  caminar al ritmo de ese tumbao,
 
Vas bailando y cantando por las calles de tu bello
pueblo llamado  el rinc√≥n del mar
 
calles alegres que te ven todos los dias
cantando y bailando el romance de tus canciones
que sabor llevas mujer caribe√±a con ese tumbao.
 
Siento que me despiertas
 todas mis emociones 
al verte pasar cerca de m√≠.
Bailando al ritmo de tus caderas 
 
Cuando estas conmigo
Siento cerca tu  palpitar
de tu cuerpo apasionado
 y ese perfume de mujer 
que tanto me hace suspirar.
 
Me deleito viendo tu caminar
por las orillas de tu precioso mar
que se llama el rinc√≥n del mar,
con ese don se√±orial
que llevas dentro de ti 
que sabor llevas mujer caribe√±a con ese tumbao.
 
Deseo tenerte de nuevo en mis brazos
sintiendo tu tierno calor
junto  a mi pecho
para luego hacerte sentir  mujer
y  deleitarme con ese tumbao
que llevas dentro de ti. 
 
Doy gracias de haber nacido hombre
para luego que cuando  est√©s conmigo
hacerte sentir  mujer
que sabor llevas mujer caribe√±a con ese tumbao
 
Que vivan las mujeres
que viven en el rinc√≥n del mar
que nos hacen enloquecer
con solo sentir su aroma y
perfume de mujer caribe√±a,
y ese  tumbao al caminar.
OTRA VEZ MI GENERAL BORRACHO
Corr√≠a esa suave brisa decembrina levantando ese polvillo que traen esa calles polvorientas de mi querida Barranquilla, se escuchaban los totes y triquitraques, alegr√≠as por do quier , las ni√±as se levantan antes de empezar el 7 de diciembre de cualquier a√±o y √©poca, corr√≠an alegres y con sus potecitos de colores regaban con agua esas calles polvorientas para apaciguar ese polvillos que entraban por las pupilas de sus ojos, y con sus  escobitas limpiando esas calles, llenas de pedazos de madera y basuras para colocar en cada casa esos faroles de m√∫ltiples colores que se encend√≠an en cada vela que las fuertes  brisas las apagabas y las tumbaban, y hacia que muchos farolillos se encendieran, corr√≠an de un lado para otro tratando de nuevo poner a funcionarlos, mientras nosotros los ni√±os ya comenz√°bamos hacer nuestra pelota de trapo que luego se incendiaban para jugar con ella, pate√°ndola  con todos los amiguitos que ven√≠an de otras cuadras y nuevos amiguitos que ven√≠an a pasar sus vacaciones con sus t√≠os, se compart√≠a muchas alegr√≠as, luego de una jornada dura de m√∫ltiples juegos, como la penca escond√≠a, el arran yuca, o que pase el rey y quien quiera pasa, la peregrina, se termina el amanecer, d√°ndole bienvenida a las bullas de los grandes pick-up, que ven√≠an a retumbar quien sonaba mejor y con sus famosas puyas quien ser√≠a el ganador, con esto daba inicio las fiestas precarnavaleras, y as√≠ cada barrio procuraba tener la mejor caseta, pero siempre hab√≠a una que les ganaba a todas, esa era la caseta de los Vergara, porque tra√≠a a los mejores orquestas y conjuntos vallenatos, me quedaba por fuera de esa caseta, pero ten√≠a la suerte que viv√≠a detr√°s de ese patio currambero, y escuchaba hasta la madrugaba todas esas canciones que tanto me gustaban, los d√≠as pasaban alegres, escuchando una sola radio de dos bandas que hab√≠a en esa cuadra, con esas novelas de amor y esas de terror que las colocaban a la media noche, que nos hac√≠an orinar el colch√≥n ,y  cuando nos levant√°bamos nos daban nuestra paliza, y los fines de semana todos nos reun√≠amos a escuchar por esa vieja radio de tanto usarla se hab√≠a desgastado, todos ten√≠amos que guardar silencio para escuchar los partidos del equipo de la ciudad, y cuando se escuchaba un gol, todos sal√≠amos a abrazarnos como si fu√©ramos ido al estadio romelio Martinez, se guardaba silencio porque el due√±o de la radio se enojaba si no lo dej√°bamos escuchar a su gran campe√≥n, su negro perea, su gran √≠dolo como el color de su piel, desgastada de tanto arrastrar las carretillas que transportaban las mercanc√≠as en el mercado de barranquillita, sonre√≠a con su tabaco dentro de su boca, masticaba y luego expulsaba lo que produc√≠a con su tabaco, nos hablaba de su pueblo natal, y nos dec√≠a que no hab√≠a un lugar en el mundo como su rinc√≥n del mar, con las mejores playas y mujeres ardientes, y as√≠ pas√°bamos todas las noches reunidos escuchando las historias de cada uno de ellos, esos adultos venidos de todas partes, de las costa Caribe y del interior del pa√≠s, all√≠ estaban todos ellos con sus mil y una aventuras que nos transportaban a su mundo, y ah√≠ estaba el gran Mariscal, con sus historias de guerra civil, transmitida  de sus ancestros y antepasados, julio lopez, marcos y rafael Maldonado los hermanos de guacamayal, cerca de macondo, y Pedro Almanza el mas juniorista de los junioritas con su bandera grande que llevaba cuando jugaba su equipo del alma jugaba en el estadio romelio martinez, que nos dice que cuando muera, que arropen su atuad con esa bandera, y faltaba el m√°s alegre y bullanguero el propio Juan Vergara, que no dejaba fiesta y parranda sin bailar y mamar ron, y siempre andaba emnaicenao, un d√≠a Juan Vergara parti√≥ con el viejo Victor y el joven Rafael  Martinez para Venezuela para nunca m√°s volver, y con todos ellos estaba mi general como siempre borracho, escuchando todas esas historias, solo sonre√≠a y pocas veces hablaba, porque hab√≠a estado en la guerra de Vietnam y una estillas lo hab√≠an malherido, todo lo hab√≠a perdido hasta su apellido que se desprendiendo de su uniforme en la guerra de Vietnam, la poca pensi√≥n que recib√≠a del gobierno, solo le serv√≠a para una peque√±a pieza hecha de cart√≥n que su sobrina le hab√≠a regalado y quien le daba su comida, d√≠a tras d√≠a, mi general siempre, siempre venia borracho, hasta que un d√≠a no se pudo levantar m√°s de su cama de lienzo y all√≠ muri√≥ mi general, solo acompa√±ado de su perro callejero llamado el astuto y de su gata llamada bendita suerte.",Neutral,9.54,83.12,7.34,-0.02,-0.1,5,a-Bd5PjpeDc,Enrique Iglesias

1. Foxy hears the pipes so whenever you finish, run away immediately and do a pipe that is far from the recent one you did

2. The pipes are progression, there are 3 animatronics (that I know of). Foxy obviously is always active. Spring Bonnie (the one you saw early in the game) activates around 3-5 pipes in and is just a slower foxy. At around 10 pipes is a Freddy-type figure whose movement is fun (hint: think of the endo skeletons in security breach)

But the ad didn‚Äôt sound right so I went to their website and this 20% reduction seems to apply to each gallon produced. But US dairy produces tens of millions of gallons more overall today than 15 years ago so, in absolute terms, the industry‚Äôs green gas emissions have actually gone up. And either way, advertising is intended to increase sales which will naturally increase emissions, right? Also, most US dairy cows do not live in the conditions shown in this video. Not even close.

I have always respected the Beast brand standing up for the environment, so it really hurt my heart to hear Jimmy thank dairy farmers for all they do for the planet.

Six months after the 8 months, the same bites got red and itchy again, all in the exact same spots.  Fortunately, they quickly faded away shortly after that.   But even after the 8 months, I knew they were not completely gone as of yet, due to me having taken niacin to obtain the niacin flush effect, which increases blood flow to the skin, giving you a tomato red skin look.  My overall body turned reddish, except the bite areas which were pure white in comparison.   And so at this point, the body was still minimizing blood flow to the bite areas.  The bites on my neck had caused beard hairs to now grow wild and crazy, and in all wacky directions.  I kept pulling those hairs out until they stopped coming back.

Been watching you from the very beginning of your YouTube career and throughout the years, it has become a routine of mine to watch a new video of yours in bed, before sleep.

I miss old YouTube, collaboration videos with others such as PewDiePie and CinnamonToastKen, etc. I know those days won't come back, and that's okay. I've let go of it.

That would make him killing himself pointless, as he would have less opportunities to escape. This would also fix the obvious issue of him sitting at the bottom of a lava lake or blowing everyone up with a bed. The hostage still shouldn't be able to be attacked by mobs or players or attack them himself I think that was a good idea on your part.

A guy (Johnny Truant) finds a book in an old blind guy's (Zampano's) house detailing his (Zampano's) recollection of and thoughts on a ""documentary"" (that's not real) that he ""saw"" (he's blind, remember) about a *_third guy's_* (Will Navidson's) personal encounter with a lot of unexplainable things, called ""The Navidson Record"".

The only problem is that, according to Truant, there *_IS_* no documentary called ""The Navidson Record"". It doesn't exist at all. Much less as the ""cultural phenomenon"" that Zampano claims it was.

Supposedly, Navidson found out that the measurements of his house didn't match from the inside to the outside. The documentary... documents (duh) his explorations of that phenomenon, from those seemingly ""human error"" beginnings, to Navidson's house collapsing in on itself both metaphorically and literally. I'll *_leave_* (see what I did, there?) the rest of the account to you to find out if you choose to dig through this ""ancient ruin on top of another ancient ruin that never existed"" of a book, if you want.

Then Navidson released the documentary about those events. Then Zampano dictated to his nurse the words written on the unfinished manuscript, then Truant found that manuscript. Truant reads through the SCP-ass document and starts having vivid hallucinations and going crazy. The story bounces back and forth between Navidson's firsthand account (well, retold by Zampano), Zampano's story (well, told by his nurse) and hinted at by his writing choices, and Truant's growing psychosis and personal life/drama.

It's a story written by a guy (Danielewski, the author) about a guy (Truant) finding a story written by a guy (Zampano) about a guy (Navidson) who made a movie about some stuff that happened to him.

55380,"As soon as you mentioned this mod was based on House of Leaves, I got SO EXCITED!!! That‚Äôs my absolute favorite book, and I know so few people who have read it. I‚Äôd say this game loosely captures the feel and general theme of the novel - the book is, essentially, a frame story within a frame story about a House with a constantly changing floorplan and a mysteriously appearing labyrinthine hallway which includes a seemingly endless staircase down into a Pit with a Minotaur. Once you started realizing that the house kept changing around you, and getting bigger and wilder and changing styles, and there were windows inside that weren‚Äôt outside, and the doors to the outside vanished, and you would go downstairs and end on a higher level again, and then that AWFUL GROWLING, I started feeling the HOL influence and got a little bit of that old zing of fear that I felt so viscerally the first time I read the book. 

It‚Äôs an intensely scary novel, masterfully crafted, and while I will and DO recommend it to everyone, it IS a difficult read, people aren‚Äôt exaggerating. It takes a lot of focus and you have to be able to juggle several different frame stories/timelines - that‚Äôs definitely not something everyone can do, and honestly probably not something I think I could do anymore either haha - the last time I actually read it all the way through was YEARS ago. ADHD brains may not find it friendly! It is a frustrating journey to read it, and while that was a challenge I welcomed and reveled in, it‚Äôs definitely not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. And it‚Äôs not a novel that can translate to audiobook at ALL lol. So I would say if you are interested, give it a try! But no guarantees it‚Äôs gonna be something you enjoy the structure of.

I think what this game does well is trusting whoever's playing to halfnotice something minor isn't how it used to be, and that's what I personally like about House of Leaves.

3565,"""The Lorax"" is a remarkable movie that has captured the hearts of audiences around the world since its release in 2012. Directed by Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda, the movie is a faithful adaptation of Dr. Seuss's beloved book of the same name. It tells the story of the Lorax, a furry creature who speaks for the trees and tries to protect them from the greedy Once-ler, who is destroying the environment for his own selfish gain. There are many reasons why ""The Lorax"" is the best movie, from its beautiful animation and memorable characters to its important message about the importance of environmental conservation.

One of the most striking features of ""The Lorax"" is its stunning animation. The movie is a visual feast, with vibrant colors, imaginative landscapes, and wonderfully expressive characters. The filmmakers clearly put a lot of effort into creating a world that feels both magical and grounded in reality. From the whimsical Truffula Trees to the polluted wasteland that the Once-ler creates, every detail in the movie is carefully crafted to create a sense of wonder and awe.

But what really makes ""The Lorax"" stand out is its memorable characters. The Lorax himself is a lovable creature with a big heart and a fierce determination to protect the environment. The Once-ler, on the other hand, is a complex and tragic figure, driven by greed and a desire for success but ultimately consumed by his own selfishness. Even the minor characters, such as the singing fish and the Bar-ba-loots, are charming and endearing, adding to the movie's overall charm and appeal.

Of course, ""The Lorax"" is more than just a visually stunning and charming movie. At its core, it is a powerful call to action for environmental conservation. The movie does not shy away from showing the devastating impact that human greed and exploitation can have on the natural world. It also highlights the importance of taking action to protect the environment, even if it means making sacrifices or taking risks. This message is especially important in today's world, where climate change and environmental destruction are major threats to our planet and future generations.

In conclusion, ""The Lorax"" is the best movie because it combines beautiful animation, memorable characters, and an important message about the environment. It is a movie that both children and adults can enjoy and appreciate, and its timeless themes are as relevant today as they were when Dr. Seuss first wrote the book. If you haven't seen ""The Lorax"" yet, I highly recommend that you do ‚Äì it is a truly unforgettable movie that will inspire you to care for the planet and all its inhabitants.",Positive,1.57,10.9,87.53,0.86,4.3,5,vnWBidMw8sc,KSI

Its how you address it after. As a competitor its really hard to be honest and say I was throwing a hook, it may not have made contact on the core portion of the glove and during the follow through my opponents head moved forward and my elbow made full contact. This is what it looks like based on frame by frame examination of the hit. Again its really hard to be the bigger person and say it, but things happen and its best to go with it since anything else hurts your credibility with actual hard core boxing fans. I want to say again based on the fight, the way it was going there is no justification in saying this was intentional. You were clearly winning to that point so its absurd to think you wanted to risk a DQ with an intentional foul. On paper Fournier is considered a ""real"" boxer, but I think that's giving him way too much credit. He is a boxing hobbyist, but still a step up. I wish  the elbow didn't land because I wanted to see how you would have done in the following rounds. Things looked good, but again as a long time fan of boxing there are thousands of fights where the first few rounds make it feel like a blow out only to become competitive.

Never in a million years did I think I would ever see Jack play a game that I MADE! This is absolutely mind-blowing and I am beyond honored to have my creation featured by one of my childhood heroes.
THANK YOU!!

ADDING AFTER WATCHING THE VIDEO: What a journey...
It is such an unexplainable experience to be able to watch someone who is one of the most inspiring and genuine people on the planet experience AND ENJOY (and rage at) something I made.
I was going to add timestamps to my thoughts while I watched, but instead, I just recorded my reaction to this video and will be uploading it AS SOON as it is edited! I'm honored and mind-blown and I'm running out of words to describe how this feels.

I guess now I have to make another game to thank Jack for playing my game...

45837,"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hitpoints, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks.
The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring.
His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider.
Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.
Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.


Strategy


Offensive


He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them.
Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a ""Hog Rider Rush"", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of Dark Elixir, and sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, Giant Bombs, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels.
At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air.
At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage.
They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together.
A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP.
Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast.
The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons.
Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base.
Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps.
Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time.


Defensive


Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders.
Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses.
You can place Spring Traps and Giant Bombs in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps and Giant Bombs can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush.
Hog Riders can be easily killed using ""forced pathing"". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time.
Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders.
In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings.
Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them.
Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants.


Upgrade Differences


The Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
Initially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands.
At level 3, his hammer increases in size and turns black. The brass bands on the hammer's head disappear, and the hammerhead goes further down onto the stick, creating a button looking object on the top of the hammerhead.
At level 5, his mohawk turns from black to orange, making it similar to that of a level 5 Goblin.
At level 6, his hammer gains three large, golden spikes and a bronze plating.
At level 7, the edges of his hammer start to glow red, and he gains a brown headband but reverts to a black mohawk.
At level 8, his hammer is now mostly golden. His hog also gains a headband.
At level 9, the gold on his hammer is much thicker. His headband also lightens in color.
At level 10, his hammer turns a bright light blue color that resembles the look of ice. This matches the theme of Town Hall 13. It also gains a small same-colored glow.
At level 11, his hammer turns a light greenish color. This matches the theme of Town Hall 14. His hog gains gold armour on its face and muzzle.

I heard what happened to Tecnoblade. I‚Äôm so sorry. Well everyone once in a while has this sad empty feeling when someone you have known so well leaves. It is just the circle of life. It happens to everyone. I know how hard it is to lose a close friend and everything, but we need to stay strong. The SMP will hopefully stay as strong as all of you are. If you feel like you should start a new SMP with the rest we would all totally understand. Or if you just wanted to have a break we would also all understand. I‚Äôm sorry for the pain you guys all have to go through. It has been a tough time without the good content creator Tecnoblade. Nut we can all agree that life turns on us sometimes, and that life is just as hard on you as it is on us, so please stay strong guys and remember to, 1. Seek help if you need it. 2. Have a break if you want it. 3. Stay strong always. 4. Live, laugh, love. And 5. Remember Tecnoblade.

They would create these super realistic videos with fake testimonials and promises of easy money. It was like a whole underground AI scamming industry, man!

They were planning to release a new AI bot that could literally manipulate anyone's voice and make it sound like a famous celebrity. I couldn't believe my eyes, dude!

For those of you who don‚Äôt know, noodling is when people stick their limbs into holes underwater. The goal is to get a catfish to chomp down on your arm so you can pull it out. 

In Louisiana I saw a guy pull what looked like a 7 foot blue catfish out of the water after it chomped down on his arm. The catfish near drowned him after he got the top half of his body dragged into the hole. 

When I was talking to him about it afterwards, he told me that one time he pulled a 130 pound blue catfish that chomped on his leg. You know what they say about fishermen and over exaggerating but it‚Äôs entirely possible that he actually did that.",Neutral,37.79,51.69,10.53,-0.27,-1.35,5,T2fxrJ6ZmfY,Dude Perfect

529,"I rarely comment on YouTube, but I want to commit to this summer shred challenge by updating this comment every day. I haven't exercised in months! But I used to follow a couple of Chloe's workout programs during the pandemic, which I remember helped me a lot :)  My goal is to lose 2kg (I weighed 63.8kg at the start of this challenge) and feel better about my physical health before going on a vacation. 

Day 1 (24.05.23): Completed. Did most of the low-impact versions of the exercises. Tried my best for the abs-video.

Day 2 (25.05.23): Completed. I felt a bit sore after yesterday, but I feel proud that I exercised even after being out all day today. For the 1minute challenge-video I decided to do a 30second challenge instead because I didn't want to push myself too much.

Day 3 (26.05.23): Completed. Because I was going out all day today too, I decided to exercise before I went out. I was still sore, and it was 13 hours since I did day 2, but I'm proud that I completed day 3! For the 1minute challenge, I manage to do all but the planks (did them 30seconds instead) exercise in one minute.

Day 4 (27.05.23): Completed. I was actually surprised that I did day 4, as it's Saturday and I'm usually very lazy on Saturdays, haha ^^ Because it's rest day tomorrow, I decided to push myself more today. I did the first HIIT without doing the low-impact versions :) For the HIIT 1minute challenge, I managed to do all of them for 1 minute except for the last four when my right knee started to act up, and I didn't want to push myself more after that. I definitely worked up more of a sweat during today's exercises, and felt my arms and thighs burn.

Day 5 (28.05.23): Rest day. I went for a slow 30min walk.

Day 6 (29.05.23): Completed. I felt really good about the workout today! Worked up a sweat, felt my thighs burn, and I managed to do all the plank exercises without collapsing, hahaha :)

Day 7 (30.05.23): Rest day.

Day 8 (31.05.23): Completed. Today was challenging. HIIT went good, worked up a sweat. However, as I have weak upper body and core strength, I found the other two videos challenging. I barely hung on the plank exercises, and I had to take longer breaks between the exercises for the abs video. I felt the burn in my arms. But I finished!

Day 9 (01.06.23): Completed.

Day 10 (02.06.23): Completed. I didn't really have motivation today, but I forced myself to exercise. I sweat more today compared to the other days, and I feel I've gotten a bit stronger as I managed to do both scorpion and hip dips (am usually bad at those). I also took a 1 hour walk for my mental health as the weather was nice. I sit too much during the day...

Day 11 (03.06.23): Rest day.

Day 12 (04.06.23): Completed.

Day 13 (05.06.23): Completed. I felt really good about today's workout, it really made me sweat! Which is good, cause I kinda have been stress-eating a little bit today... I had to start preparing for my master thesis' presentation and defense, which is next week ü•≤

Day 14 (06.06.2023): Rest day. I did go for a 50min. walk in sunny weather.

Day 15 (07.06.2023): Completed. I struggled a bit with set 2 of the full body workout, but I did finish them! Also enjoyed the abs-workout today :)

Day 16 (08.06.2023): Skipped. I didn't feel well today, so I decided to skip so I wouldn't feel worse.

Day 17 (09.06.2023): Completed.

Day 18 (10.06.2023): Rest day.

Day 19 (11.06.2023): Skipped. I was out all day and came back home late. I didn't wanna exercise as it can be too loud for neighbors while it's late.",Positive,2.57,19.86,77.57,0.75,3.75,5,JDgc6CxwEMI,Chloe Ting

580,"a couple years ago, when i was 12, i almost finished one of chloe tings challenges but i stopped early. now, i‚Äôm 14, and i want to get my hot girl summer going and also just start working out more consistently, so this will be where i update every day!

day 1: ‚úÖ i sweated a TON, literally i had to wipe my face off with a towel many times. also had to take some couple-second breaks during the harder exercises, but i completed both workouts. also i want to mention that i‚Äôm on vacation for a couple weeks so hopefully that won‚Äôt hinder my ability to do the workouts. anyway, excited for tmrw!

day 2: ‚ùå i was super busy today and couldn‚Äôt do it on the day i was supposed to :( so i just decided to do it today. i actually sweated less today and didn‚Äôt take any extra rests on the first vid; maybe bc it was an easier workout, but either way i‚Äôm proud of myself. however, during the second vid (the challenge vid) i did have to take some extra rests during and in between exercises, but i‚Äôm ok with that.

day 3: ‚úÖ still sweated a lot and during the first workout, i took almost no rests during the exercises; however, during the 1 min challenge vid, that was def not the case lmao. what matters is that i got through the workouts and i‚Äôm feeling even more ready for each upcoming day!

day 4: ‚ùå once again, super busy. completed it the next day and sweated a lot, but i definitely have started taking less and shorter breaks since day 1!

day 5/6: ‚úÖ day 5 was a rest day but i skipped it since i didn‚Äôt do the workouts on other days. although they‚Äôre still hard, i can already feel how much stronger i am while doing them!

day 7: ‚ûñ it was a rest day and i was going to do it since i‚Äôd skipped other days but i was super busy and didn‚Äôt have the time to.

day 8: ‚úÖ this one had 3 workouts, but i still finished all of them with little extra rests!

day 9: ‚úÖ done! can already feel myself getting stronger every day!

day 10: ‚ùå i had to fly back home and unpack so unfortunately could not do it today (i just did it the next day). however, since i‚Äôm not on vacation anymore, hopefully i will have more time to do the workouts!

day 11/12: ‚úÖ day 11 was a rest day but i skipped it bc i took that other day off. i completed day 12 with no extra rests and was not as exhausted as i was after earlier days which i am super proud of myself for!

We had nights of endless music
We were dizzy dancing 'til the dawn
We were free, singing sweet harmonies with the city
But maybe that was someone else's song

Back to Earth again
You knew where this was headed and honestly you're better off
Better here where you belong

You got caught up in the colors
You got wrapped up in the ride
You thought the feeling was forever
And the stars were on your side
It was lovely while it lasted
But it wasn't meant to stay
Still, you let yourself get carried away
I guess I let myself get carried away

We got carried away, carried away
Got carried away, carried away

So we got mixed up in the madness
But wasn't it a perfect mess we made?
Well you live and you learn, you read signs and it's safe and it's simple
And behind our walls we fall back into place

Back to Earth again
You're through with pretending 'cause this is how the ending goes
Now you're here where you belong

We got caught up in the colors
We got wrapped up in the ride
We thought the feeling was forever
And the stars were on our side
It was lovely while it lasted
But it wasn't meant to stay
We just let ourselves get carried away

61030,"Wow! This video is a gem! Sandeep Maheshwari has once again delivered an incredible talk on how to grow your intelligence and increase your understanding. His Hindi sessions are always so impactful and relatable.

One key takeaway from this video is the importance of continuous learning. Sandeep ji rightly emphasizes that intelligence is not fixed; it can be developed and expanded through consistent efforts. The examples he shares and the practical tips he provides are so enlightening.

I loved how he highlights the significance of curiosity and being open-minded. By staying curious, we allow ourselves to explore new ideas, perspectives, and knowledge, which ultimately helps us expand our understanding of the world.

Another important aspect discussed here is the power of reading. Sandeep ji explains how reading helps us broaden our horizons, gain new insights, and sharpen our intellect. His personal experiences and book recommendations are motivating me to dive into reading more!

Moreover, I appreciate his emphasis on seeking clarity in our thoughts. By simplifying complex concepts and breaking them down, we can enhance our comprehension and retain information more effectively.

Lastly, the practical exercises he suggests, like meditation and journaling, are great ways to enhance our focus, concentration, and overall mental well-being. Implementing these techniques in our daily lives can truly lead to a significant boost in our intelligence.
