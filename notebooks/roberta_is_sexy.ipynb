I was shocked to find the wall was to be 4ft thick at the base.  I got my calculations checked by a Professor of Civil Engineering and he told me I was spot on.  The guy I was doing the drawings for (a garage cut into an embankment with another persons house near the top of it) decided it was all rubbish and cut the ground away to build without the retaining wall.  I withdrew from the job only to read about 5 months later as the ground dried out the land had slipped damaging to the the new garage and the other persons house.  The idiot went ahead without local authority consent.  It cost the guy big time as his insurance would not pay and his neighbours insurance also went after him.

Because of this, the retaining wall on half the site wound up starting to fail, effecting the basement of the building across the street. All equipment was removed from the top of the hole while they figured out what to do, eventually going with longer dirt nails and restarted that half.

I've never done anything like this before, so I just laid some concrete footings and built the wall!  (Back filling with soil.) I did include a few drainage holes to stop water building up, and laid the wall double, with more substantial footings (the rest of the patio base was single brick) - and of course the ends of the wall are 'tied' into the two side walls. But I did all this by gut instinct - without any real understanding of what I was doing. After all, it was only a patio!

In my opinion, it's really incredible how structurally durable & aesthetically pleasing they are despite being really simple by nature. Good examples of the use of such retaining walls would be how they're used in the raised ramparts of Japanese castles. It's worth checking out if you're curious, particularly how they're constructed. Last year, the NHK made a documentary exploring such a thing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9wGOXXoCuY ) the building featured is the Rolex Service Centre in Dallas, Texas. It's shown in the video that the traditional wall construction method has remained relatively unchanged over the centuries, and is highly labor-intensive, but if done correctly, produces little to no waste.

Obviously I have added nothing to the understanding of any soil scientist or hydrologist ( which my oldest son ended up as a master's degreed and consummate master of professionally).

      "Text: Season 5 part 2 was phenomenal. Im at a loss of words, this whole season was such an emotional rollercoaster. I laughed, cried, got annoyed, felt every human emotion ever. Part A focussed more on Deckerstar, But in Part B, other important relationships and meetings were highlighted. It is the best season ever! Lucifer is by far, the best series i have ever watched. The humour, characterization, plotlines, all appealed to me, but most importantly, As lucifer morningstar evolved in the course of the series, I evolved too. Lucifer is not just a show to me, its a journey I lived to find out more about myself. I could relate to Lucifer on several counts. He made a breakthrough in one of his therapy sessions that he hated himself. I hated myself too. He blamed himself for the sins that humanity commited though he has no control over it. I blamed myself for the sins I committed that I have no control over now. He thinks that he is incapable of love, not worthy of Chloe's love, which is exactly how i felt about myself too, unworthy of the love of my loved ones, and completely useless. But seeing Lucifer from a third person POV, you realise how Lucifer is the only one worthy of Chloe's love because of the lengths he would go to protect her, how he is precious to everyone he loves, Amenadiel, Charlie, Linda, Maze, Trixie and even Dan, he loves all of them wholeheartedly and would readily sacrifice himself for them. I too am worthy of the love I get, I am precious to the people around me. We underestimate ourselves just like Lucifer when it comes to loving ourself and others. Lucifer's devil face is a result of how he sees himself as, an embodiment of evil, and Lucifer is anything but evil. He had been misunderstood since the beginning of time and had been portrayed evil and malicious in holy texts. I too, saw myself as the Devil. But when Lucifer forgave himself and let go of his guilt, his devil face and wings receded. I realised I must forgive myself too for being so harsh on myself and feeling guilty for all the sins i committed. That I deserve some self love to bring out the angel that resides within the devil in me. Lucifer gave me hope that I can be a better person than I am, that I can change for the better. He taught me to always tell the truth no matter how bitter it is.Ella taught me how everyone has darkness in them, and it is important to accept it and let the brightness in us shine. Because the darker the darkness, the brighter the light. She also taught me to have faith in the big guy even in hopeless times. Maze taught me how love can make you weak but also more stronger than you think. Amenadiel taught me to look at everything from a positive, unique perspective. Linda taught me to confront my emotions and admit them, rather than trying to conceal them. Dan thought me how life can pull you down, but its upto you whether you choose to stay down or pull yourself up. Chloe taught me to believe in myself and my capabilities no matter how hard people try to make me doubt them. God taught me how nothing lasts forever. Trixie taught me to be optimistic in the darkest of times. Every character in Lucifer teaches an important lesson. This series made me wanna be a better person, and that says a lot about it. Im proud to call myself a lucifan. I watched all 5 seasons with such enthusiasm that i cannot wait for season 6. I am disheartened that i completed watching the 5 seasons, and wont be able to watch anything new in lucifer for another year, i think. I thank the makers of lucifer for creating such a beautiful show. Lucifer has left a deep impact on me and helped shape me into a better person. I hope it changes you too❤️ \n",

Easy to mistake but the dorsal fin being less fleshy and more fin-like is a good tell. Also the fact it looks like a dang wacky catfish and stays on the bottom of most bodies of water. They look like catfish sharks they're really amazing, but they need tons and tons of space.

It gives insight to the moments we never knew about before. I also never knew that Selena had so many different hairstyles and experimented so much on her look. I also think it's cool they are using Selena's actual voice, it's great they are staying true to that. However, I feel like the casting, specifically for Selena, is off. I get that not even JLo herself looked much like selena but at least she was able to dance like her and bring out her charisma. They could've hired someone who looked more like the actual Selena and also had her curves. This girl is decent at acting, but it could've been better as far as the physical aspect.\n",

As in AB's struggles, and Suzettes story of trying not to be completely overshadowed by the over all ideal of SELENA. And Chris - yes, even Chris I found a little more interesting this time around. I believed those crazy kids were feeling awkward about their feelings and having to have to hide their relationship at such an odd and young pivotal point of their lives. Selena the film will always be seen in higher regards of course, but the series has me feeling some other sort of way by exploring the characters youths more. Sometimes, watching the film, I forget how young Selena truly was - and how young and naïve things had actually been for the family as a whole starting this crazy, though beautiful, Mexican-American dream.\n",

I refuse to buy any of her music and/or stream it--I still have her old CDs and that's how I listen to her. All of that money go to those gross individuals and it sickens me. I want to watch this mini series but since both of those men are going to majorly profit out of it, I likely won't tune in.\n",

It didn’t really hurt, but it just looked bad because of the blood. We had a sub that day who was a bit strict, and when I walked up to him he was talking with another student. I tried to interrupt him to tell him, and he said, “Are you on fire? Are you bleeding?” In a sarcastic tone, then said, “Then go back to your seat”, expecting me to have just wanted to ask a question that could wait. I mean, I was technically interrupting his conversation. I told him that I actually was bleeding and showed him, and he freaked right out lol. He took me to the bathroom and helped and showed me how to rinse it off with cold water and then apply pressure to stop it from bleeding before adding a band aid. He made sure to listen to everyone for the rest of the day and for any other time he subbed for my class lol\n",

It was red and had the weird cylindrical instrument cluster and spherical turn signals, all thanks to Italian design firm Peninfarina. The SECOND year Suzuki sold their RE-5, all were painted black and they had normal instruments and turn signals. They still did not sell well. I got my red one for half price at the dealership, when it was a year old _demo model_ with 498 miles on it. I kept it completely stock, except I added a full fairing. That made it a joy to ride, even for long distances like 500 miles in a single day. It was perfectly comfortable cruising at 80 mph, with no numbing vibration in the handlebars or footpegs and no buffeting by the wind. It also had enormous torque, even at low rpm. There was no need to slip the clutch for a quick getaway, just crank the throttle and simultaneously dump the clutch. It went 0-to-30 mph in the width of a 2-lane intersection, barely laying rubber, with no tire squeal. For the first half of a city block, it was quicker than the screaming, clutch-frying 1100 cc piston \"superbikes\", despite the rather hefty weight the RE-5 had and the rather tall gearing. (It would go 50 mph in 1st gear, 80 in 2nd, and 115 mph in 3rd gear.) In highway riding at 55 mph with my friend on his 1200 cc Harley, I would challenge him to pick any gear, while I would stay in 5th gear as we simultaneously rolled on the throttles. I never failed to outpace him by a comfortable margin, despite my being in 5th gear, amounting to _second overdrive._ The only major downside of the RE-5, in my opinion, was the poor fuel economy. It got as little as 12 miles per gallon while riding it 3 miles to work, in the winter, with choke on the whole time because it took that long to warm up.\n",

However, back then merchants will not get their money not until the user confirmed his/her purchase has been delivered. However, not all of the users actually spend time dealing with customer service, and these asshole merchants getaways from some of this scam. I really think Wish is a sinking ship and I am surprised that they are still in the business.

This moment echoes that because Atsumu, wanting the point desperately, wished to use the speed of his quick with Atsumu to score...but in turn was blocked by Kageyama and Hinata, the only two that could react in time to a spike they were so familiar with. Speed is a weapon, but also a curse. People like Nekoma's Inuoka, and even Tsukishima back when the twins first copied it could shut it down because they had time to adapt to it.\n",

The synchronized attack, an attack where everyone works together and just trusts that the ball is going to them, and Tanaka being the one to spike it after being mentally torn down in this match. After it gets blocked, Tsukishima, Mr. It’s-just-a-club himself, is the one who chases the ball to the end of the court, tapping it just before it is able to fall to the ground. Then Daichi once again being the most reliable teammate, showing us he is the captain for a reason, getting the ball back onto the court. Then comes one of my favorite parts, where Yahaba hits the table yelling for them to go back, this doesn’t only show us that the rivals are rooting for them, but how memorable Karasuno has become, they were nothing, just clipped crows and barely remembered by the other teams, but now one of their biggest rivals are the ones rooting for them. THEN the twins quick, where they use Kageyama’s line from the first freak duo quick, but Kageyama and Hinata block it, the rival quick team is being blocked by the freak quick team. Kageyama, the one who rather do everything by himself and Hinata who only cares about spiking, working together to take down their own attack, GROWTH AMIRIGHT!! But that’s not all, we see the ball, reflected in Kita’s eyes, hitting the ground. Kita, the captain, who has only ever played in third year, the one trusted with every loose ball, his eyes are the ones we see Inarizaki’s defeat through. \n",

That just tells you that Hinata in that moment was the only calm/chill one because the hit was on purpose he was only to be able to take a sec and look at his surroundings and make that decision. 2) Tuski and Daichi’s receive like that just self explanatory 3) That teamwork block of Kageyama and Hinata I just loved how it wasn’t just they both jumped and it hit one person’s hand and went back but they both touched it and threw it back. 4) Tsukki realizing that in that last second that Hinata and Kageyama were the only ones that weren’t fazed and had enough strength in them to block the twins.

I cry now ... and cry a cry I have never cried like him in my life because of the amount of feelings in this album..Bangtan always makes us cry out of joy, from happiness and sometimes from sadness ... But now..Now..i  I cry because the warmth and tenderness of the album and the song made me feel very strange..no..I cannot know what this feeling is..It makes me in a state of sadness, happiness, panic, the desire to laugh and the desire to cry ... It always gives us very beautiful feelings ..  And what you felt about this album specifically is completely different from any album and any song previously..It really ... really makes you feel a warmth and a very beautiful feeling like the feeling of your mother’s embrace of you or the warmth of your family..woooo .... This year a lot of things have happened and most of them  Sadness and events at all that we did not expect in 2020 ... it was a really crazy year! ... But this album, the songs in it, its lyrics, its melody, the beauty of its meanings and its feeling ... made me feel that this year was more than exhausting, sad and very strange..but we had Bangtan  As medicine for all of these things ... When they encourage us when they make us happy, make us laugh, or make us laugh, or make us laugh, and tell us everything will be fine and fine .. and b  Stay with us all this year in order not to be sad or exhausted in it too much ... Bangtan I don’t know how to do that..how to make us cry and laugh and grieve at the same time .. Oh, you really ... you really make me believe that we are all here to love and  We are happy, cry, mourn and happy together, not just by ourselves!  .... .. I cannot write because I am crying now and my eyes are shedding tears strongly..that is why I will say that we love you so much, we love what you make for us, we love that you care about what we love and what we want .... and you care about our grief and relieve our pain ... and you care about words and how you want them  To reach us..we love you and we will love you forever .... you are life and happiness for us..we love you very, very much..and as you please us, we will return the favor to you too..so wait ... we love you so much ... I throw anything away from you.  About our goals that we have been planning for for months ... Leave everything and focus on the album and broaden Bangtan ... Team work makes the dream come true! ..

The more I have learned and listened to regarding your music is inspiring. In all areas it bring hope in these times that are uncertain.

Even if they don't agree with each line, you are \"spitting truths\" as my LGBTQ Daughter says. Much respect for not letting this fame and attention change your soul.

      "Text: Losing weight and staying in shape has little to do with age. However I will admit it does get more difficult as you age but it all comes down to lifestyle and state of mind. People who blame covid for weight gain are shifting the focus off their poor choices. I am 43 years old and was pushing 200 lbs going into covid. Simple things were beginning to get difficult for me to do. Granted, 200lbs is not seriously obese, but I didn’t mention that I am only 5’7”. \n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to do something about it. I started off simple, only changing my diet to start with. Making healthy choices, making sure not to eat a few hours before going to sleep, reducing portion sizes. I did NOT count calories, just eating healthier things. I lost 15 lbs in about 2 months. I then began to do intermittent fasting, my fasts lasted anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. I would fast once about every week to a week and a half. Keep in mind, up until now I have not yet to increase my daily physical activity, just my eating habits. Fasting the first time was difficult because I did not know what to expect. Subsequent fasts were much easier. I encourage everyone to research the amazing health benefits of intermittent fasting, you will be amazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key note on my experience with fasting. Before changing my diet to a more healthy diet, if I had gone an extended period of not eating due to being busy or what have you, for say 7 or 8 hours, I would get dizzy or feel light headed or a general feeling of weakness. I don’t know for a fact, but I believe it was some form of effects from low blood sugar. I assume this because I could eat a candy bar or a piece of fruit or just drink a “sugary” drink and it would almost immediately subside. So I was concerned with how fasting would go. Fortunately I suffered NONE of these symptoms during my first fast or any of my many fasts up to present. I attribute it to having changed my diet to a more healthy diet months prior to my first fast. I had already cut out most of the unhealthy processed sugars that I used to eat.

      "I continued this for about 4 months. At this point eating healthy and intermittent fasting became a habit and easy to keep up with. I had lost another 10 lbs or so and my weight stabilized at a range of about 172 to 175lbs. As of about 3 weeks ago I have implemented weight lifting and yoga. I plan to begin cardio very soon. My target weight is between 165 and 170lbs. Small changes are the key.. small changes with consistency so they become habit, then another small change. \n",

      "I am so much happier when I look in the mirror, but the biggest satisfaction is from how good I feel. I feel rejuvenated, full of energy throughout the day, my clothes fit better and my body feels better. Anyone can do this, you just need to make a choice to do it, and it HAS to be for YOU, not for anyone else. Take the time to INVEST in yourself. I BELIEVE in YOU, so BELIEVE in yourself! I hope my story helps someone, you CAN do it.\n",

      "Edit: I also wanted to add one more note about my experience with fasting. During my fasts, I surprisingly did not feel drained or weak at any time. Quite the opposite actually. I was taken aback by how energetic I felt during the whole process. The hardest thing at first was the hunger. It would hit hard at first, during the time periods where I would normally be having a meal. The hungry feeling would generally last about 10 to 15 minutes, then it would go away. This seemed to continue in cycles every few hours, especially if I was not actively doing something as in just sitting around watching tv and such. However I did notice that each cycle got weaker and weaker, meaning it was easier to cope with. Many times I could dampen it by chugging a bottle of water. I later found out that there is a chemical that your body releases that creates the hungry feeling, you should look that up too, its quite interesting. Now that I am used to it and understand what it is and why I’m feeling it, I have NO issues fasting, it gets too easy. I have actually done a few 48 hour fasts and could have gone longer but I had already pre-decided when I was going to end the fast.\n",

Although Will gained 1 pound, it likely wasn't fat and he even looks slightly more toned - at least around his abdominals. Will will inevitably lose the weight if my theory is correct as his new muscle will burn more calories even at rest as long as he keeps the effort up, although now he has to lose 21 pounds in 19 weeks. He'll definitely be the fittest he has ever been.\n",
