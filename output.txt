Respect to Dortmund fans,must be sad losing him.A real talent, hope he doesn't turn into another Kagawa or Mkhitaryanwish him well in manchester unitedOne of the most talented players Bundesliga has ever seen. Sancho is fantasticWhat a spell in the Bundesliga, Goodluck in the future Jadon Sancho💪💪He’s a generational talent, regardless of his situation with England. He’s gonna light the prem up differently 🔥The amount of opportunities he creates is ridiculous. Goal and Shot creating actions tell you who can and can’t be a motor of a team. He’s definitely one of the ones who can be a motor, reminds me of a basketball Point Guard or Hockey Center…he’s gonna be good for a while 💯.Hope he does well at Manchester.  He's been great for Dortmund and I admire the way he's conducted himself during the transfer.  He didn't do us dirty and phone it in, and that shows class.Hands up to the bundesliga created a top young talent who will hopefully continue to spread talent in the premier league 🙌🙌🙌Massive, massive talent. I've wanted him for a very long time. Thank you for his development, Dortmund. We'll take it from here.This was a nice tribute by the Bundesliga to SanchoSaw him play for England the other day for first time during this Euros. He was phenomenal, not sure why Southgate waited so long to play him.Thank you for the memories Jadon, we'll miss you! 💛🖤I'm dying for him to rediscover this form for man unitedThank you for your service to Dortmund Jaden Sancho!! Good Luck at Manchester United I'm sure you are going to be great ;)He is forever a joy to watch. I wish you all the best at UnitedIncredible player 👏What I learned from the Ukraine game was that he's not greedy for a flashy winger. He plays one touch give and go and makes intelligence decisions. Utd got themselves a baller.He is creative/inventive, very young, CONFIDENT especially in front of goal (we lack that at United at present) and can think very quick on his feet (no pun), well done United.  The new season will be that much more exciting esp since we also have Amad!His arrival excites me, fans of Borussia Dortmund, we will take good care of Jadon Sancho, how great Borussia Dortmund is 🔴👏here after his first Man United goal. What a playerSo excited to see him the Prem. Hopefully the box of tricks he has can be put to show. BallerAll i can say is, good luck on your next destination.. I, like many other Dortmund fans, knew that you weren't gonna stay with us forever but absolutely no hard feelings.. I'm just glad you chose to join Dortmund when you did and also thank you for not trying to force a move last year...thank you so much for all the great memories, hope you'll have a great career and now it's time for us to move on.. #BVB💛🖤...This guy has some serious skills⚡⚡0:08 Absolutely spellbinding 🤯🤯Streetballer for life ⚽️💫Shockingly calm and collective in the box
Fantasies buy for United and best of luck to this young talented man in the premThe Bundesliga surely will miss himI like the fact that as such a skillful player he doesn't go to ground easilyBringing that magic to Old Trafford,💥💥The chemistry between sancho,haaland and reus was wonderful going to miss the trioBVB helped his game so much and deserve the credit. Sancho always had the talent but they helped him excel. He will light up the premier LeagueNever witnessed a player play like this, he dance it’s incredible 🧚‍♀️⚽️Really excited for this one. A player that actually wants to play for the club not just a. Player who is looking for the best option financially.he's a brilliant playerCan’t wait for him to kiss the badge in front of the EtihadHe is like a rolls Royce on the ball..so smooth 👌👌👌As much as I am sad that Leo Messi and CR7 are getting to the end of their careers, I believe that it is healthy for us the fans..so we can enjoy all those the media forgot about when the GOAT and CR7 were conquering the universe of Football ( Soccer )..

What a pleasure to watch Jadon Sancho..Memphis Depay..and many more.. 

2021-2022 season is gonna be lit Y'all !!This lad should have been starting every game for England in the Euros.Thank you everything you did for us Jadon, even though it's man united, we wish you the besterling may have been the star but for me sancho will always be the magical mythical wonderkid.Bundesliga will miss you SanchoOne of those great players who were produced by BVB and did not go to bayernAnother world class talent in the rank!! Lets go man UnitedThanks for everything! We will take good care of him in Manchester!Can't wait to watch him to play for us! ♥️💯I imagine this must be similar to how United fans felt when Cristiano left for Madrid. No hard feelings, phenomenal player, only fair that he wants to play in his home country.He is incredible but I think it was far too early for him to return to England. He should have stayed in Germany or moved to Spain to sharpen his skills furtherHe is one of the most talented right wingers in the bundasliga and he will be excellent for Man UtdAwwwwh, what a shame to see a player of his talent leave the Bundesliga, that being said, best of luck to him at Manchester United! ❤️Dortmund should be proud of their scouting/youth system bleeding talent such as Sancho into their first team xi year after year even after they cash in. Best in the world imo.The take-down @ 01:56 is insane , other wordlyLast time Jadon is a youtube end card :( He will be missed at Dortmund, loved him so muchOne more rising legend!!!What a player.Jadon is literally a fusion of Cristiano and Ronaldinho.. i cannot wait to see him back in England playing for United. What a player.Sancho is very skillfulI wish he plays the quarter finals for England 🤩United fan here..thanks Dortmund fans for supporting him, hope united can do justice to his talent. Fans will love him just like you did that we promiseCongratulations to Man. Utd for finally bringing him to Old Trafford. 

As for The Yellow Wall, they already faced many of their players leaving in a similar manner, but happy that he was key in bringing home the DFL Supercup and DFB Pokal. 
Ansgar Knauff will probably take place where Sancho played.My favourite player 😍Now have Sancho in our team we can finally compete with teams like City who have brilliant players like Mahrez in the same position. A few more solid signings and we are a top team again. You are doing well so far OleYour duo with halland will be missed, I  become BVB 💛  fan just because of you . All the best sanchooAs as a United fan I have been waiting for this video for such a long time 😀I love his self confidenceI love the way he toys with the defendersWish him all the best at Manchester United, from a Chelsea fanLooks a great player hope England give him a game he could make the difference.So excited to have him at UnitedThat touch though 🔥We will keep safe him in United, wonderboyAnd Solskjaer just has him warming the bench in every match.#DankeJS7  🟡⚫️🟡 always in our hearts 💛🖤💛 4 seasons full of magic momentsI hope Manchester United can get Bellingham next, after he is groomed at Dortmund. Sancho is one of the best talents in the World and Borussia Dortmund really made him realise his potential and made him world class.We will take care of him👍
Thank you bundesliga🙏absolute insanity that he hasn’t featured for England at the euros 

Imagine 

Grealish —— Mount ——- Sancho 

🥶Who else came here after #MUFC announced him? I have goosebumpsFinding a replacement for him seems hard. But i think Hofmann will seal the dealSancho is incredible player, like RonaldoPerfect footballer 👌 he is .Waww @1.19m the back heel flick is sensational 👏Most of his dribbling skills  works on when counter attackingIf Rashford can become more consistent, we will have a madness on both wings.
Greenwood developing into a proper 9 will be the cherry on top.
It could become a dream trio next to next season.Welcome to Manchester United Jadon Sancho. Can't wait to see Guardiola's face when Sancho scores at the Etihad.Sanchinho!!!!
England has never had a player like him.Every i watch Sancho he makes me smileLook how good he is at lw positionReminds me so much of Alexis Sanchez at Arsenal, can’t wait to see him tear up premier league WELCOME TO MANCHESTER UNITED JADON 🔴The romance between England and Germany. Klopp and Sancho.Welcome to Manchester SANCHO!🤩My respect for Dortmund and Dortmund fans📈📈📈Ah yes look at those United skills brilliant 🤩Good Luck Jadon Sancho For The New Club in EnglandThat assist to Götze 3:25 is my favorite 😋  wooow can't wait to see you get along with Cavani and Greenwood next seasonWelcome to Man United Sancho 🔴⚫️I already know he's very good... so it's the sound track for me✨💕I don’t understand how he can be this good but not make the England starting line up / be used as a subI wish him all the best to Man UnitedI watched him from his first match now hes gone.Danke Jadon💛🖤💛🖤🖤💛Sorry Dortmund I love Jadon big respect for making him who he is even after city releasing him/selling himThe best footballers have great football minds, it's like their brain reads the game differently and on another level from average players.💚Wish him be a united legend 💚we will miss himWish him luck to face the great defender in EPLThe best player in Englandrashy, greenwood, sancho. the three lionsHe's generational!! Welcome at the stretford endI hope he can do some magical skills at old tro.I'm loving the look of the United Frontline. Sancho, Greenwood, Rashford, Cavani, Martial. Quite impressive.Good luck for the new chapter Jadon Sancho !Wonderful playerWelcome jadon
Welcome to manchester unitedAnyone else reminded of Neymar with certain touches and controls? Boy oh boy what a player we have signed.With Sancho Sancho and rashford up in the box.. we are going to see a lot of penalties.. (Fernandes so happy rn)i hope he becomes good for man utd i have lil bit of reservation at the moment because the german league is not as good as the premier league and i remember shinji kagawa he was brilliant for dortmund but sadly couldnt make it at uts.The pressure at man utd is much more than the pressure at dortmundDamn even thou im a united fan im gonna miss Haaland and sancho crazy celebrations :DGood luck at Manchester United. Håland Will be sad when he leaves DortmundMan Utd fan,Dortmund my favourite german team,We will take care of him ❤️💛fun fact: sancho was at man city before dortmund and now he is at man utdI would like to thank the germans for helping make this kid even betterJadon thank you and good luck 🔥💪💛🖤Southgate isnt treating him nicely , he should play him more...Glory glory man United!What a brilliant prayer Jadon SanchoCan’t wait too see Sancho and Rashy make their goal celebration together 😍🔥We will take care of him XJustice for Sancho. How Southgate doesn’t start him every game is a crime.exceptional talent thoOle needs the sack so we can see the best of this guy!Looks like bundesliga respects sancho more than Southgate. what a talent.To all the numpty Man Utd fans who keep saying he is being played out of position, watch this video and take note. He plays on both wings, think he scored more goals while playing on the left than the right wing. It's amazing how many fans reckon that they know he is brilliant but have never actually watched him play!!!!You can see he was Dortmond player  high energy  attacking pacy skillsLegendCan't wait to see him grace the real half of Manchester! 🔴🔴🔴The only english player that this guy can be compared with is Kane, the way this guy plays and numbers are just absurd. After Mbappe and maybe Haaland he is the best wonderkid.Now at the biggest club in the world 
MUFC
💕Sancho 💙Can't wait to see him at Old Trafford 😊Welcome to Man United ❤️SanchoIm excited For SanchoCan’t wait for him to be in the premHis first touch🔥🔥🔥I am a Liverpool fan and I am shivering by noticing that now Sancho is Manchester united player🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶Will shine at UnitedGood luck Sanch, looking forward to you gracing the Old Trafford turf and becoming a legend 👏thank you jadon🙏💛🖤Welcome to Man United, Jadon! You will do great. Best of luckLoved it...!!!👍👍👍
Welcome to theatre of dreams...!!!Generational 🙌Thank you for giving us a preview🙏🔥🔥 Man United are excitedI like bundesliga channel...they appreciate past and future players💯One thing I know for sure...
Adminho and I will miss him when he leaves😭That kit is beautifulThank you Jadon 🖤💛🐝As United fan I welcome him at ManchesterSancho and Ronaldo would be like Batman and Robini dont remember the last time i've seen a daring English winger with flair. most English wingers are bland cross machines or speed merchants.Now he'll play alongside RASHFORD,CAVANI,FERNANDES,POGBA💥💥Still can't believe Dortmund failed to achieve smthng big inspite of having a creative playmaker (Sancho), a deadly finisher (Haaland) and a reasonably good teamHope he will do this for us manabsolutely spell binding football! now we wait to transcend this form to englandGoodbye to a goat🐐😢Welcome to  best  club in the world  jadon🔻🔴It's so sad to see Gareth Southgate not playing him at the EurosCan't wait for him to put on the united shirt. Rashford, martial and greenwood what a strike force.upcoming football Star !! 🥰🥰New youngster 💪💪💪💪 
Jadon shanco 💖
Shanco Have a best Talent.
Good luck For Shanco 💖I know he'd get his form like this for man utdSancho assists Cavani to score😁Crazy this guy cant get into the England starting 11 , he might be there best attacking playera baller !I was never confident about Sancho.  12-18 months ago, I wondered about the hype with the over priced tag of what was it - £100m?? And I thought Utd should leave it.  Maximum bid of £40-£50m but leave it at that.  Preferably don't sign him at all.  Now they have signed him and so far, I am not being proven too wrong.  He has never performed on the international stage either.  Let's wait and see.Has potential to be the next Ronaldo/messiSancho <3 
Thank you.Welcome to Manchester United the theatre of dreams sir 💯💯I hope he became much stronger and healthier in Manchester ❤️❤️All i can say is, good luck on your next destination.. I, like many other Dortmund fans, knew that you weren't gonna stay with us forever but absolutely no hard feelings.. I'm just glad you chose to join Dortmund when you did and also thank you for not trying to force a move last year...thank you so much for all the great memories, hope you'll have a great career and now it's time for us to move on.. #BVB💛🖤...🚧 Keep up with all my projects here: https://practical.engineering/email-list
🥑 Get some free meals from HelloFresh with code PRACTICAL14 at https://bit.ly/3xWacPOYour mechanically stabilized earth video inspired many days of sandcastle building at the beach with old cereal boxes and other cardboardAs a professional landscapers who has built quite a few retaining walls I can tell you that managing water behind a retaining Wall is critical for its longevity.I love that he’s a civil engineer and his name is Grady. Grading is very important in civil engineering. He was born for this.Thanks to videos like these I massively overdesigned my own retaining wall in my garden and now it will last a few centuries at leastI was on a housing board where several retaining walls came into question. One had experienced some crumbling near a sidewalk. We were concerned that it might collapse and injure someone. In time, we replaced I believe six retaining walls. Retaining walls were very expensive. Most builders don't build them. The only builder we could find that could build them was the same builder who built the original walls 20 some years earlier. The new retaining walls have a nice look to them. They improved the aesthetics of the neighborhood greatly.I only ever did the calculations for one retaining wall and I used Reynolds text book to do my calculations.  As I still understand it the thickness depends on the 'angle of repose' of the material being retained (in my case sand) and the overturning moment due to the height.  I was shocked to find the wall was to be 4ft thick at the base.  I got my calculations checked by a Professor of Civil Engineering and he told me I was spot on.  The guy I was doing the drawings for (a garage cut into an embankment with another persons house near the top of it) decided it was all rubbish and cut the ground away to build without the retaining wall.  I withdrew from the job only to read about 5 months later as the ground dried out the land had slipped damaging to the the new garage and the other persons house.  The idiot went ahead without local authority consent.  It cost the guy big time as his insurance would not pay and his neighbours insurance also went after him.  Not only that he was sued for damages uncivil court and also fined for unauthorised development.  The moral is....do it right the first time.I recently helped a friend renovate her mother's property and they were wondering why the water bills were so high. The house has a paved terrace out front with a timber retaining wall at one end, which was starting to collapse. Turns out the mains water pipe came in under that end of the terrace, and subsidence due to the failing wall had caused the pavers to break a t-joint for a garden tap on the exterior wall of the house (poor plumbing design there), causing further washout of the soil. I'm now imagining such an event scaled up to "large civil project" size... yikes!You're single-handedly saving my interest in my course, and quite possibly saving my future career as a barely competent Civil Engineer. Thanks 👍🏻 from a graduating student from the Philippines.I live right near the NJ project. It was wild when it happened. One day it's fine and lightly raining... the next the whole side collapsed. If they ever release what happened to it I would love to see you cover their findings like you have with other project failures in the past.The soil-shear failure mode is really impressive, I had never heard of that.  Are there any notable examples of such a failure?It's only a very small exaggeration to say that your videos are the reason I signed up for an Integrated Master's of Engineering with the UK's Open University.  I'm just three months in but loving it.  Thank you for inspiring me!I remember your video on Mechanically Reinforced Earth specifically because it blew me away. The cube of earth that held up your car got me hooked on your channel and I have been enjoying it ever since. 
   I appreciate that your channel is so informative about principles that operate in the background and go unappreciated by the general public, yet is so vital to our society in every day life. Thank you for sharing this with us. It is very much appreciated.Years ago as a baby apprentice electrician, I worked on a job that went 6 stories down from the street for parking. They had built a temporary wall while excavating held up with dirt nails, but while doing that, they unearthed a shipyard (including a complete whaler!) and had to call in historians and archeologists to better preserve what they found. Because of this, the retaining wall on half the site wound up starting to fail, effecting the basement of the building across the street. All equipment was removed from the top of the hole while they figured out what to do, eventually going with longer dirt nails and restarted that half. It was cool for me as a first-year on my first big new construction job, as I learned an awful lot about how buildings are actually built. 

Thanks for your always interesting videos. I am always happy to see them in my feed!My mom has a retaining wall behind her house, she got it put in because she wanted her yard to be flat in 2 levels. That 4 foot rule applied exactly here and thats how tall the wall was because "they cant make a wall over 4 feet without city involvement" fun fact the wall has collapsed 3 timesI was on my HOA board for two (terrible) years, and among the many contentious maintenance projects we had to address were many retaining walls that had washed out or otherwise destabilized over time. I don't envy anyone who tries to convince stubborn skinflints that yes, it really is important to have someone who knows what they're doing to build these things, and we can't just cheapen out and do it better ourselves with stuff we buy at Home Depot.It is critical to understand is that the soil composition itself plays a huge role in what can and can't hold up in terms of slope.  Clay is pretty resilient to slump up to a point where water starts messing with it.  I've also been told that the types of tree root sysems matter as well, so getting trees that send roots down, instead of in a wide root ball, are better. Not sure if that's true.Great video as always. I've been practicing Civil Engineering for almost ten years and am always impressed at how well you're able to break down and illustrate concepts that felt so complicated when I originally learned them. Jist curious have you ever thought about getting into teaching?I also learned that in Japan, retaining walls have been a focus of legislature because so many walls are too old and can't stand up to earthquakes. Tragically, a school kid died after a retaining wall failed. I live far from a fault line, so I'd love to learn more about how we build structures to stand up to earthquakes!Earthquakes can be a challenge as well. We live in Alaska. Hwy approaches suffered during the last large quake here. We have some pretty unstable soils that turn to gel when shaken with enough force. Thanks for the great video. I love learning the physics of why things work or don't work. Merry Christmas to you and your family. Thank God for Jesus!As a new geologist at a geotech firm, I’m learning as I go about the engineering that follows our work. It was very satisfying to see you cover concepts I’ve worked on and to learn about others I may encounter. Thanks for the great video!It's been quite a few years since I took and passed my Architecture Licensing exam in California. Thank you Mario Salvadori for your structural lessons. I seem to recall several questions about retaining walls on the General Structures portion of the exam but not on the Seismic portion. Maybe you can speak to that on another occasion if you haven't already. 

On another note I am considering signing up for the HelloFresh service as I am quickly approaching the need for a retaining wall around my waist since retiring a few years ago. The horizontal thrust of the vertical food deposits are beginning to take their toll from the added load."I love innocuous parts of the constructed environment" is Grady's best line ever. It should be the tagline for the whole channel.You have have really put an efforts to make this video to explain it to us in easy and simple terms. Big fat thanks to you.Frankly, as a software engineer,  I've always been surprised that retaining walls stay up.I live in New Jersey and I have been waiting for the report on this collapse.  Immediately after the collapse, a retired civil engineer friend with connections to NJDOT told me that NJ tried blaming the contractor for not following the spec.  The contractor replied with a warning letter that they submitted to NJDOT that it would fail.  Then all went quiet.  There are multiple ramps that were built up in this project including the half of the roadway in the picture that didn't collapse.  They are still proceeding with other ramps but one has to question is what was already built wrong too?Hi Grady! Years ago my brothers and I built retaining walls, and we used hooks with horizontal rods that ran the width of the table and were hooked onto a wall in the opposite direction! We have never had a wall fail yet!!!As someone who’s in the process of engaging an engineer to redesign a failed retaining wall at home, installed years ago by someone else, I have a new-found respect for these walls.Nice topic.  One item not mentioned is a term that civil engineers use for the angle at which different material transition from stable to unstable. It's called 'Angle of Repose'. I think Wiki has a page on it.Reminds me of a group project when I was in secondary school, where we gather information about different types of geotechnical reinforcements. Each student get a kind of reinforcement to present and I got geotextile. Brings back memories.12 years ago, I've built a 80cm retaining wall with my mother. It's made only of rocks, so water isn't a big issue, and we plant bushes on it, hoping it will stabilize it. After 5 years, it became pot-belly-shaped, but I'm pretty proud of it because I didn't watch this video at the time, and I was so young!I design retaining walls (precast modular and segmental block) every day and often struggle with getting clients/contractors/architects and even other engineers to understand the basic concepts. Lots of engineers love to place cut walls right on the property line (because the architects have used up all of the space) and then they can't understand why they need easements to cut into the neighboring property in order to build the wall from the bottom-up. I think I need to just start sending them links to your videos.Your simple demonstrations are so valuable to explain these concepts, even as a seasoned engineer just helping to visualize something is so valuable.  Visualization is so important as an engineer especially when trying to explain a concept or a problem to someone not technically literate.Yet another brilliant video Brady and team!! Thanks! Proud to be a sponsor of such great content!Again an awesome video! Your consistency in the quality of your videos is really something else.I built a big deck on my house some years ago that involved a 4' tall poured concrete retaining wall.  I was perfectly confident speccing out the posts, beams, joists, rafters, etc myself, but I absolutely sought the services of an engineer for determining how the retaining wall should go.  Built everything to his exact specifications, and 4 years later the only damage I can see is some almost-invisible cracking straight down the control joints put in for that exact purpose.  5 stars, would engineer again.Thank you for featuring the 42/295/76 interchange in one of your videos! I drive by it almost every day and wonder how they will overcome the issues at hand there. Rumor has it there is an underground river that was missed. Extremely challenging project of very limited easements, tight property lines, continuous traffic, within wetlands makes that interchange project one of the longest existing I’ve ever seen. I remember when they started working on that in 2003! Great video, thanks Grady!!Interesting.  When the Anthony Henday Freeway was being built, I was wondering how the builders was using the multiple large orders of grout (10,000 bag orders).  I thought it might be used in the joints in the bridges or maybe the interface between the concrete and asphalt.  It makes more sense they were using them to fill the nails on the retaining walls.  I was on the factory floor making the grout.My background is mechanical engineering, but work on civil projects including among other things MSE, precast T Walls, temporary shoring,..... 3:55 is a great way to model the soils. I imagine granular backfills could be modeled with from poligonal to triangluar pegs.I started watching your channel with the mechanically stabilized earth video as a senior in high school. Now I am about to graduate college with a degree in civil engineering. This channel has been such a big part of my path to this career. Such a fitting video for you to postCivil engineering is a fascinating science. 
Thank you for bringing it to us in such an understandable wayI live very close to this collapsed retaining wall in NJ. It's amazing to see such a construction failure up close and first hand.Excellent summary of retaining wall types.   When I was designing buried structures, earth loads used to worry me more than anything else - I was usually quite happy with the calculated forces on steel or concrete, but an error in the assumed strength of ground could have massively expensive consequences.I've worked in construction litigation (lawyers for construction stuff) for years..... and I can tell you that failed retaining walls are about 50% of the cases I've worked with.As an old landscape contractor contractor that was incredibly informative and interesting!! Thank you!Thanks for making this video! I love the demos you provide, they make understanding the physics so intuitiveFun fact: I was driving my sister down to visit family the other day and drove past a short retaining wall on the side of the road. I remember when it was installed about 15 years ago. When it was installed, it leaned the right way - top leaning in towards the hill. Now it leans out. Someone didn't engineer proper drainage for the wall, and Colorado's expansive soils combined with 15 years of rain have pushed the wall out. 
So it's interesting the timing on this video :)Honestly before this video I used to look at retaining walls and wonder how the hell they actually held that much material back. The amount of potential energy there is enormous. My question was not why do they fail, but why do so many of them workLove your videos and always will. One suggestion when showing your experiments. Make the footing a different color than the dowel (dirt). It was pretty hard to see haha.On the topic of water, we had (or rather, still have, but to a lesser extent) a very similar problem here with an underpass. Previously there was a factory a few hundred meters upstream, which pumped _loads_ of ground water (I recall a graphic showing levels of easily 10m below what they original were spreading to over 2km downstream), and doing so since before that underpass was constructed. Since the factory shut down, those water levels obviously came back up and they actually had to implement multiple fixes to the underpass, as the weep holes were constantly gushing water and flooding the sidewalk there. Can't be too great for the structure either, but obviously it's strong enough so far and constantly monitored as well.Friend of mine had a big pool next to the house on the side of a hill. The pool area next to the house was supported by a railroad tie retaining wall. About 20 years after the concrete construction of the pool started to leak, the deep end was 13ft. The side of the pool wall was only about 10 ft from the retaining wall. Started to see signs the retaining wall was failing as it started to lean outwards after a couple of years after the pool started to leak. The father sold the house, new owner drained and filled the pool with dirt in an attempt to stop the retaining wall from failing completely, which would have also let the house collapse with the unloading of the foundation. We are 90%+ clay here in northern NJ.I’ve been a safety person for over 25 years with 15 in geotechnical construction. Your videos are such a great learning tools for our young engineers and safety people. Keep up the great work.I go to school down in South Jersey and remember when this collapse occurred. Luckily I don't commute but I remember the headache that this caused for my professors and the students who commuted to school because of the closures.

The construction projects in our state are years behind schedule and simple projects have taken decades to complete.With us it turned out that a mountain slope that a road leads past is not stable but slowly slips off. This resulted in major fortification measures. Retaining walls with drilled anchors were built below and above the road. These are preloaded and few even have dial gauges on their heads. The whole mountain was also measured by fixed points in order to be able to measure future movements.
But that must have cost a lot of money.I've worked on heavy construction projects around the world for my entire career and still find your videos interesting.What a great learning experience I just had from all of your clear explanations as well as your perfectly built demonstration display.  A genuine thank you from me.There was a pretty good example of a slope failure in construction at 151st street and I35 here in Kansas. Engineers built an east/west bound bridge crossing over a North/south bridge over the interstate. For some inexplicable reason they built the support columns for the east/west bridge on the fill above the slope instead of  through it. The weight of the bridge eventually buckled the concrete covering the slope and they had to close the bridge for repairs.I remember decades ago, employed by a state highway department, we in the geotechnical section tried to convince in-house structural engineers to try MSE walls, geotextiles, geogrids, soil nails, etc. but to no avail. It was cantilevered gravity walls or 3:1 slopes. If we had had Grady's simple, intuitive, learn by seeing, displays and models I think the department would have saved millions of dollars in design and construction costs by moving ahead into the future. Instead, at that time, the only way to present these concepts was by formulas, equations, graphs and (if we could get the research money) demonstration models.When I was a teenager I helped a local farmer build a retaining wall for someone to park their car on a slope. It failed within a few months, and we realised why, dug it all out and did it again! If only this video had been available 40 years ago!! 😀Thanks to you i'm seeing everyday structures differently than most people do. 
An honor to be one of your subscribers. 🙌Your videos truly are amazing. Thank you for sharing your hard earned knowledge with all of us. You deserve all the success coming you way 🙏Each time I watch one of your videos, I'm always amazed about how little I know when it comes to engineering, how many factors you need to take in consideration when building everything and how complex it can be.I’m working for a special foundations company and right now I’m on a job where we are building secant walls in conjunction with soldier piles and lagging (not sure if you mentioned the latter). Love to see videos on this stuff, wish I had seen it in university to give me an introduction to the construction side of foundations engineering because I have to say I was illiterate to most of the terminology going in.Love the retaining wall videos!! Please make more!!Very insightful .. always had problem in understanding lateral pressure ☺️.. kindly do more videos on soil mechanicsGrady. VERY cool video. Please keep making these. I wish that I had applied myself in school and pursued engineering. Your videos are a way of experiencing that dream of pursuing engineering...  :)Im a practicing archaeologist who spends a lot of time on construction sites when they are doing subsurface work and your videos are both entertaining and professionally valuable! A wise operator once told me that it only takes 1 yard of dirt to kill you. Retaining walls may be invisible but they are so critical!DAM, you're right - I'm looking at such walls now AND seeing the mistakes with non-engineering consultancy in their design. Fascinating.These are the ones I've definitely noticed the most, and those "ugly" pipes that have huge cones of stained water running down them are a common feature.The one MSE wall that I know had a failure was a result of poor backfill.  They had thought all stone was the same but didn't realize the stabilization strips needed a stone of minimum surface friction.I live about 15 minutes from where that retaining wall collapsed in New Jersey. That entire project has been going on for more than 10 years now and it was so depressing to see my hopes of normal traffic flow literally crumble into rubble.This is exactly the video I wanted to watch! The city is building a new overpass near where I live, one side has huge sloped earth up to the road, and the other side has a huge (10-15ft tall) retaining wall and every time I drive by there I always think how can they keep that soil from spilling out! Thank you for thisHere in Melbourne the railways are removing level crossings, some locations by digging the tracks and stations into new narrow trenches with vertical retaining walls of several types you mentioned (the old railway trenches were dug with sloped sides) let's hope the designers and engineers knew their stuff, only time will tellI was actually wondering about these the other week when I was in a canyon town. Lots of retaining walls, lots of homes built on top.Your knowledge of and excitement about these topics always draw me in. Thank you for teaching me and so many others about things we wouldn't think of otherwise.I remember watching the mechanically engineered dirt video shortly after it came out. It was so amazing how it could hold your car up after the regular dirt just collapsedHello fellow Jerseyans, seeing our little neck of the woods is really cool. Here's to another 10 years of constructionYES!!! I watched this disaster happen and have been living through the traffic of the constant construction and the aftermath of the collapse for a decade now. As soon as it happened my first thought was "Man, I really hope Grady covers this"Turns out I've been watching your videos for a lot longer than I thought. I didn't even know that the mechanically stabilised earth video was one of early ones and I distinctly remember it still. Thanks for all your great stuff.Super fascinating Grady! I'm wondering if you have any insight to how humans have terraced slopes for thousands of years, for agriculture? It seems to always be above 25' slopes, also usually irrigated, and the earth is disturbed regularly. How is that possible?Although I'm not an engineer (of any sort) this video did strike home on a personal note.  A couple of years ago I built a patio in our back garden, and because it was on a slope, I ended up having to build a six brick high retaining wall at one end. I've never done anything like this before, so I just laid some concrete footings and built the wall!  (Back filling with soil.) I did include a few drainage holes to stop water building up, and laid the wall double, with more substantial footings (the rest of the patio base was single brick) - and of course the ends of the wall are 'tied' into the two side walls. But I did all this by gut instinct - without any real understanding of what I was doing. After all, it was only a patio! Now I'm sitting here wondering how silly I might be looking in a few years time...Very cool video I subbed because there is no other channel like this that makes me think, about structures and the engineering that goes into making them safe and stable for years to come...This might be a regional thing, but I think schotcrete (or however you spell it) is used here (in belgium) and then decorative masonry is added to it. I've seen this a lot in historical areas around my city, because by using thin, rough stones it gives a cobble-stone look that fits in with other old constructionworks and roads.I love the fact that Grady just has random concrete samples on a table in his houseI have built all kinds of walls and embankments in Southern Ohio. I had just built a block wall with geogrid embedment and drove past a shopping center just told my wife that wall wont last. Im a field engineer so I couldn't explain it but could just see the wall was wrong. Sure enough 3 months later have a heavy rain, the block were in the parking lot.Talking about retaining walls. Have you seen the ones used by Medieval Japan? In my opinion, it's really incredible how structurally durable & aesthetically pleasing they are despite being really simple by nature. Good examples of the use of such retaining walls would be how they're used in the raised ramparts of Japanese castles. It's worth checking out if you're curious, particularly how they're constructed. Last year, the NHK made a documentary exploring such a thing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9wGOXXoCuY ) the building featured is the Rolex Service Centre in Dallas, Texas. It's shown in the video that the traditional wall construction method has remained relatively unchanged over the centuries, and is highly labor-intensive, but if done correctly, produces little to no waste. Like most long-standing traditions, it's basically akin to a practical art form now.I was confused at first thinking you already did a video on this when I remembered Road Guy Rob recently did a video covering retaining walls as well. It was more roads, less engineering, so this was still very interesting. Love both your channels.At my previous house, I had a stone retaining wall in the yard that collapsed on me while I was mowing.  (No major injuries, just total surprise.)  The man who rebuilt it for us buried four "deadman" anchors made from concrete blocks behind the wall and tied the wall to them with steel rods.  We used to have fun telling people that there were four deadmen buried in our yard.Another great one Brady! Nice to revisit this topic, the mechanically stabilized earth video was the one that got me hooked to this channel.no wall could possibly hold all the love I have for this channel.Thanks for the great video. I appreciate the education/explanation prior to going into why the wall failed.An underground parking in my home town in Belgium was made with pile walls. They first drilled the retaining pile walls, then made the concrete top, and only then started to excavate the parking. 

You can still see the ceiling of the parking is rather rough, and the walls also aren't covered and just show the concrete piles.

It had a big advantage for our town, as that area was still usable during most of the construction works. I believe they even did the top in two parts, to allow the bus lines to keep using the square. And it greatly reduced dust in the environment, so less complaints from inhabitants.My first time in Japan, I was astonded at some of the retaining walls.It's difficult to appreciate the effort and technologies involved in heavy construction without informative videos like this. It's not contemplated in the average persons daily life.I always watch Grady's sponsored segment because it is just him being a wholesome family man.I'm finishing up a foundation design course this week. We covered shallow and deep foundations, mats, retaining walls, and a whole host of geotech topics. It was an invaluable class for me to take, and seeing this video come out today on my last week of class was the cherry on top. Thank you Grady!Hosted, written, and produced by civil engineer Grady Hillhouse, Practical Engineering is the world’s largest, most subscribed-to, most respected and best video channel for civil engineering, architectural engineering and construction with no compromises or restraints. Once again you have given us the video that becomes the curriculum. BRAVA, endless BRAVA!!These videos are really enlightening in my casual everyday life. Makes me think differently about things on why they are and how they are.Cool video! I build rock retaining walls, that’s how I’ve always explained it to someone it being a “gravity” wall. Essentially wall weighs more than the earth it’s retaining. Never has a wall failed that we’ve built!!Is there any resource showing how to simulate forces acting on a residential construction like you show with your transparent box filled with sticks? For example wind acting on a roof structure, live load acting on a floor, etc.Even before the video started my thought was, “OMG, this looks so fascinating. How the heck does this guy make stuff that I would’ve thought was boring so darn interesting?“ Thanks for another great video.An interesting project for a video in the future would be the issues in BC Canada this year with what happens when all the roads through the province got washed out or covered in landslides. How do places upgrade their infrastructure to not have these kinds of issues happen in such a large area. It was shown how essential it is to have infrastructure remain in use or the economy suffersThis is great as always pal, and I did think of a couple as a none educated (observant) but some surprised me :) I wouldn't have thought of layering synthetics with the earth. The first example with partly building under the earth and wall interests me in particular, I find if a way can be found to use natural engineering it'll be superior in most cases-what if that tactic could be implemented so it proper melds into the earth, being part of it. Maybe using the first method with anchors too. I wonder if there are many other techniques than what's mentuoned hereThe I295/Rt42 collapse did not have the drainage finished before the wall went up. It is believed to be part of the cause for the collapse, with some other questionable engineering issues as well. I’m curious what the final outcome will be for the collapse report. I travel through this interchange multiple times a week.I love how in the intro you can see just the tiniest hint of a glimmer in the eye, a slightest twist of the smile as Grady thinks to himself “I’ve been waiting to sneakily lobby for retaining walls for so long”This video explained an insane number of engineering things where I live that I've always wondered about about but never known how to Google/ask about.This is awesome you’re covering this. Drove by it a few times and just couldn’t wrap my head around itHonestly retaining walls are the single part of infrastructure that I do actually think about when I drive past. They always feel somewhat sketchy to me knowing how heavy soil is5:36 moderately fast refrigerator

Other than that, thank you for the, as always, very informative video.
The way you explain topics is always so clear and fascinating2:56 - No way! I remember learning about specific _heat_ in high school. I had no idea there was such a thing as "specific _gravity_ "
I love this channelI've been wondering for a long time why residential basement walls don't collapse under the pressure from the surrounding earth. This video answered some of those questions but I would enjoy a video or other discussion of how these ideas apply specifically to residential basements. As always, thanks for the good work!!Something in the background of many of these videos is the issue of design standards. Often engineers get used to a solution and apply it in every situation. This isn’t all bad as having a good solution to a common problem saves tons of engineering hours and is ultimately cheaper. But if you don’t do you’re do diligence and make sure the standard/instinctive solution is adequate in a given situation, you end up with big problems.Here I am, a Geotechnical Engineer… I teach all this and still thoroughly enjoyed your video. Good work!I like the old world method of construction.  So heavy that it could never possibly fail!The star shaped forts in Europe, that became popular from the 15'th century onwards, largley had to handle this exact topic. When cannons became more and more popular in sieges, the old medieval castle did not hold up as before. So they built huge earthworks with stone facing - in effect retaining walls - that held up to cannons fire better. I think it was a frenchmen who cracked the math for keeping said Wallström stable. But I cannot remember his name.I love learning new information from you while I work!! Thank you for doing what you do Grady!Excellent explanation.  Never thought about walls in such a wayThis guy could make the process of watching paint dry interesting. Another good video!Hi Grady, I would like ask, if is possible, a series of videos showing and explaining ancient techniques and their evolution till todays techniques. Like soil engineering  techniques used by Inca people in Machu Picchu-Peru, or Dome construction techniques as in Hagia Sophia-Turkey, or earthquake resilient building ancient techniques in different cultures like Japanese, Incas, Aztec, Tibet, Mediterranean, Central Asia... 
Your channel is very nice and your ability to communicate such topics it's amazing. I am your follower more than 3 years and every single video is a delightful knowledge comprehension experience. Thank you.Man, it just makes me realize that even just the things that faciltate construction and building are far beyond my life of mental knowledge! I like how there's so much engineering in retaining walls..and the wall itself sometimes isn't even the project! And great end of video cooking bit, I love these!really good video, mentioning main types, that plastic net soil reinforcement with multiple levels looks good, is there any program that calculate those? i might offer for some of our objects. I always tend to overengineer these walls, well because safety and concrete is kinda cheap. Thanks for great video.This channel ticks my autistic brain like no other. At this moment there are two new TV show seasons that I've been waiting for for months but this channel is way too addicting so I keep watching engineering videos. Thank you for making Youtube a better place. You'll get this 🥇 2021 award for the best newly discovered channel.I often drive through this area and never knew why it has been under construction for SO DAMN LONG!Damn.  Between this New Jersey collapse and the bridge beam failure in Tennessee, that's two places I've driven a heavy truck on that are now featured in a Grady vid.  Also reminds me of that concrete panel that detached in Boston and killed that poor lady.  Spooky.  Stay safe out there people.In aquascaping almost every hardscape/decoration is a retaining wall. It will either loosely hold substrate to mimic a natural scene or secure that the substrate doesn't erode over time to keep the aesthetic.I was watching Science channel or something at my parents place during Thanksgiving vacation (I don't have cable so this was a trip!) and I saw Grady on one of the episodes about a crane failure talk for several seconds about soil stability or something. Go Grady!when i saw the retaining wall for the backyard fence, it reminded me of many landscaping projects I see in the neighborhoods where the walls start leaning or fall down because of improper support...it looks good when it is completed but it is only a matter of time before it gives into forces of gravityFun fact, residential brick house walls often have weep holes, and homeowners who don't know what they are often seal them up, with predictably unfortunate consequences.7:12 The scale of this building site is really impressive 😮Tge old reinforced dirt episode is probably the video that I'll remember the most. Something about it being such a simple solution that I should've been able to guess, and it working so damn well just blew my mindIn my neighborhood, the subway system is in the phase of underground extension.
To build one of the underground stations the engineers seem to have used a technique not mentioned here 
(unless I have understood nothing in the explanations, however very clear).
Before starting the excavation they dug  the location of all the retaining walls surrounding the pit 
(~ 10 m X 10 m and ~ 15 m depth) by flooding the trenches during digging to avoid their collapse.

Once all the trenches were dug, they replaced the water, drowning the trenches, with concrete thus forming the retaining walls (there must surely be reinforcing bars but I did not see them). 
it is from the moment when the concrete has been completely dry that they excavated the zone delimited by these exterior walls.6:42 was T2T, a project local to me in Adelaide South Australia. We also had a wall partially collapse at Bedford Park in Southern Expressway extension.i live in PA and i saw this collapsed wall in person while driving through NJ! i immediately thought of this channel and was going to request you cover it, but I see you are already on it! great video :)Hey Grady! Could you pretty please do a video one day on how engineers construct the parts of a bridge that go down into the water and rest on the riverbed, and support the bridge structure - I don't know what they're called really (the legs?). But they are like magic to me - I don't understand how they built them, or how they don't get swept away by the currents of the river. As I read somewhere, they often use these sheet piles that you mentioned in this video to create a water-free space right down to the riverbed where they can start putting the foundations? Would totally love to see a video about this! Love your channel!So after seeing this retaining wall video. It made me think about the Salt Lake City Temple site which is having its foundation reinforced to better withstand an Earthquake. I would love to see a video about adding earthquake safety to large buildings.I was shocked that I recognized the retaining wall that collapsed! I don't commute for work and it's been a while since I drove across to Philadelphia but that spot has been a traffic nightmare for a while now.Seen a lot of road construction in Central Florida done this way, most notably in the multiple points of the expanding I4 project. Never felt it was being done safely. i expect many roads/ overpasses built like this will have major failures in the future.Funnily ebough, I _have_ notice them before. I honestly thought the concrete was decorative. Thank you for covering this!It's good to learn a little each day, thank you Grady for providing me with some learning today! 
Marvelous episode, looking forwards to the next one!I worked on a site where they had to remove a section of a retaining wall.

I don't know WHAT on earth they'd thought it needed to retain, as the site was undeveloped, but the wall holding back a 6' change of grade went several feet below the lower grade AND was an inverted T shape with a footing that was 18-24" thick, AND was so full of rebar that even with the large track-ho with a ram they brought out to break it up, they could barely perform the work.Several years ago I looked at a new construction house to buy. The A/C unit was located on the top of a retaining wall. There was several feet of retaining wall around the house. I mentioned to the Realtor, that the location of the A/C unit looked precarious because it was on the top of the retaining wall. She wasn’t concerned. I tried to explain to her that earth is continuously pushing against the bricks and eventually, the wall could fall. Since she didn’t know how the wall was constructed, and I couldn’t tell either, I decided it wasn’t worth the risk. She did not understand my concerns. And was generally annoyed at me. Maybe I was wrong, but I wasn’t chancing it. I’ve seen retaining walls fall.As the daughter of an engineer I do understand trying to make others see what you designed and how to build. As a citizen  I've watched every main project built with concrete in this town go to the same keywit that refuses to let us watch them build it and also every structure they made has failures.Awesome video!
I'm sure I'm not the first one to point out that Grady is a great name for someone talking about soil levels!Grady, I don't know if you've been following the spec house building project on the YouTube channel the Essential Craftsman, but they're building a house on the side of a hill, and early on they had to create two sets of retaining walls for the project. It's a pretty neat set of videos. I think you'll like them. They're now finishing the mechanicals inside the house as far as video timeline is concern. But the house is completed and already sold. (Shucks, Grady. You missed out on your chance to move to the Pacific Northwest by about a month or two.)I pass by this every day. I don’t think this construction will ever end at this rate.The 42/295 interchange has been being worked on since my mother was a kid.  With the wall collapse, it'll probably still be a work in progress when I'm her age.Always informative. Keep up the good workYour little practical demos are fantastic. The concepts you show with some dowel and acrylic summarize a lot of my college classes in seconds.Great video ....
Love the way you explain all the engineering behind it.. 😎I live in a hilly part of Ohio along the Ohio River so retaining walls and slopes fill prominent roles in day to day life.This looks so similar to the Houston, TX 288 expansion wall that, didn't seem to collapse but the road way basically started a sink hole. They just finished repairing it like last week."slopes are waste of space".. I'm  a structural engineer, within the field of civil engineering. This statement rings so true..One of the most deadly things on construction sites are trenches, they may in fact be the cause of more fatalities than any other thing.  Trenches are voids with walls on either side.  The weight of soil is not to be trifled with.I love watching your videos, there's always something more to learn when you release a videoAs an old renovator and retention wall builder, I can tell you it primarily boils down to releasing hydrostatic pressure, and insuring that your tiebacks are well anchored versus the horizontal force of the restrained mass.   In the final analysis, non transportation platforms may be allowed to slowly erode via weep holes, while road and rail foundations must be robustly supported and the underlying material be effectively drained at all times without significant erosion. Obviously I have added nothing to the understanding of any soil scientist or hydrologist ( which my oldest son ended up as a master's degreed and consummate master of professionally).  Would that we all be better mathematicians, and could trust our own vector force calculations assuming maximal moisture content of the restrained mass, such as after a tropical depression has soaked the area for days on end.Great video, but you need a 2:1 or 4:1 audio compressor (instant attack, 250 ms release) to normalize the whole thing. You can gate the noise off before that for more effect. Sidechain compression is what drives "ducking", where the music is automatically turned down when you speak.Yet another excellent video about engineering. Thanks. A few days back, I noticed some abstract patterns on the sidewall of an underground station. I knew it was made by seeping water and admired them as abstract art. But now I realize and appreciate they were made by water seeping holes in the concrete wall holding the tunnel up. Art produced by Engineering!!This man is great. He gives his daughter privacy, donates money, and helps out the community. You are going to be a great dad.Man is a genius, going to get to write that off from his taxes, give back to the community, get the P7 and get a shoutout from Seth. Probably going to make money from buying this bike from all of the videos he'll be able to post.This is obviously more important than schoolJared seems like a great person. For sure gonna be chucking out his channel.The dislikes are the people who didn’t get the bike.I’m glad a dude like Jared got it. Seems like such a chill guy ✌🏼Awesome! great to see the community of MTBers come together and fund trailsMe: wait its not Friday

Seth: pulled a sneaky one on you there.Congratulations on your new baby bud and thanks for helping people ride bikesI was expecting the same when the bike's price reached $57,000. I knew either the person was really rich or really idiot.Damn, it was good to see the P7 go to a good home. I hope you feel better soon so we can get back to the older content of you building berm peak. I miss that stuff for sure.Your doing so many good things Seth keep up the good work!Man Seth, you’re going to be an incredible dad!You need to do a ride around the whole backyard man love the vidsWay to go Seth, always doing what’s right👍🏼Straight up love the community outreach programming! Sustainability within the communityThanks for everything, Seth!!Great job for all involved. I'm in Louisiana and I didn't know about trail riding. It's so flat here, I'm in the southern part of the state, Its cool to see folks out on the trails. I will be adding Jered's channel to the list.Thanks so much Seth. Bogue Chitto is my local trail, and we are so excited about the soon grand opening which in my opinion will be the absolute best MTB trails in the Gulf South by far. They were professionally built with the help of ridiculously dedicated locals (NORBA). Jarrod's contribution is equally as exciting. Be sure to check out his channel.Mad respect to Seth for still pumping out videos lolPicked up a couple scx24 for myself and son. We have been having a blast building little courses out of random things in our home. Thanks for helping everyone stay sane during these crazy times!you got me into mountain biking and i am loving it thanks for the great content!You deserve so much more support your amazingSeriously, how could anyone dislike this video? It's all positive and constructive info!!!?!That's awesome.  I've been saying that his channel should have been getting way more traffic that it was getting.  Hopefully this helps give it a boost.This is how community works.... Well done everyone.Seth, we love your videos ✊!!! Keep going! Hope your foot gets beter.Awesome! Glad to hear that it went to a great home!Nice to see it go to a good home and for a good cause!Couldn’t have gone to a better dude. I’m so stoked for the slalom course at the new trail system.I love the content Seth so glad the p7 went for good. ❤️Hey Seth. Hope your child is happy and healthy but we want more videos man.Would love to have a bike like the P7 with that setup. It just looks so gorgeous.😍Can't wait to see you back on a bike, Seth!both of you guys are great on mtb community.What a win win win outcome!

Well done to allYeah Jared! Trails are looking sick, way to go bud!I can't wait for the "parent hacks" content to come !!! congrats on selling the bike and the new baby Seth!You know it Gonna be a great day when you wake up to a berm peak notificationHi Seth, I was impatiently waiting for your video! Congrats, now you're a dad! Also, please make videos of bike upgrades since I love them.... A heart from you would mean the world to me! Anyways, I'm a huge fan of you. I started to love mountain biking bcoz of your channel and you!Hey Seth, really bummed eBay messed up to that extent. Love the content and congrats on the baby!Love your vids keep up the great workFinally! How's your recovery doing Seth? We wish you all of the best!Love the content Seth 💙So happy it worked out and went to a good homeSeths Daddy Hacks are in full swing by now I am sure.  Good to see you standing.  Thanks for the update!Those P7s have got to be one of the best looking hardtails around.That's so awesome bc I live in Mississippi and have gone and rode the trails in Bogue Chitto while they were and still are being built! I cant wait for the grand opening this spring!!crazy story alert

first time i saw this bike on seths channel i fell in love with it , and scoured the webs trying to find one that fit my specs, medium frame, colour in orange , right price etc. FINALLY found one after 6 months of looking and bought it at a great price. After 4 months of riding this bike on general jumps, drops trails and tracks the frame cracked around the seatstay in three places. Absolute Pisstake.Congrats on the baby man and love the berm peak sign at the back!!Your channel has inspired me to buy a bike and become a mountain biker 🚵‍♂️ thank youI’m glad someone finally followed through with their purchaseLet's do another cooking with Seth video.
I loved that.God damn the P7 looks mint!! Very Jealous.....though can't say I'd pay that much for it without Fox 40's on it.This may not end up being a bad investment. For that price, he got the bike, supported the local trails he rides on and made a big advertisement for his channel on well known channel with hundreds of thousands viewers looking for MTB related content.I like how Cure Cycling went from 1.5k subscribers to 5k in one day....only Seth can do that to a channel.Love the content Seth keep it up ❤️❤️Anyone notice Seth redid the area above the tool wall? Love it.Dang! took a while but I'm glad you finally did. Hopefully you can get back to riding soon.Great Vid as always Seth, the shops looking great!!! So cool that you finally sold the P7Jared seems like a pretty rad dude, definately gonna have to check out his channelI know its impossible but it would be nice if these videos came out moreWatched the fix-up video and had to find out what it sold for.  $6500... would I have bought it?  I'd have thought long and hard about it.  Probably, in the end, I'd have passed on it because the frame is a little too small for me but it was a super compelling build.Nice job seth love the vidsWhen I clicked on the video I realised how tired Seth looked then it noticed the red bull as well😂i remember when the bike went upto $AU70,000 i was shocked as seth said you could buy a bentlyKeep up the good workLove that bike!! Would love to do a future build that’s similar! Also liking the look of that berm peak sign on the wall in the background! 🤔👍Good video, keep up the good work!Do you ever plan on building up a Downhill bike? 
Love your videos, keep that great work up!🔥🔥🤙Seth can you do a big bike check soon? I’m wondering what you’ve done with all your bikes?I love ur vids keap it up your great 👍And finally ! Great your old/new P7 has gone to a good home👍Hey Seth I just wanted to ask and see if you could try out a 80 cc motor on one of your mountain bikes I think it would be coolCongrats Seth by selling your p7 😀😀
BTW I wathed all of your videos even your oldest one to thisThat bike is a work of artLoved the vid, just had an idea. Do you think you could get tracks for snow and install them on the scx24? that would be a cool videoWould be super cool if you did a trip to visit those trials in Louisiana with Jared!Congrats on your child❤Seth when are you going to rate DH parks again? That was such a fun seriesAn MTB video! YAY :D Hope youre doing good Seth!Super Pro content like always 🤩👍That new berm peak sign in the background looks sooooo good 🤘Love your vids Seth!Just realized the big Berm Peak sticker and blue led's above the tools. Love it!I really like the berm peak sign that lights up. It is really cool.Congrats on the baby!That's a smart $6500 investment. Paid off the instant Seth gave him the shoutout.we need more rc videos!!!$6,500 for a great bike and a shout-out from Seth. Plus it goes to funding your local trails and it's a tax write-off. Boy, this would be a stellar deal to anyone with a mountain biking YouTube Channel.Has to be the most beautiful bike I've ever seen.This is the definition of a berm peak express videoBack in the 90's NORBA was an organization you had to belong to in order to race in the US. National Off-road Bicycle Association. Basically a license to race. Just like BMX.ABA. Alot has changed since I raced yrs ago. Keep up the Awesome work y'all! Go ride🚴The one that didnt pay broke the rules of ebay. If you bid for something and the auction ends, you have to pay whatever cames. You have toHe’s gonna be such an amazing dad 😎I love these videos I’ve watched every single one of them like five timesJared is a sound person I think you should all sub to him !I just got out of the hospital for something you warned in a video about bike grips, I had just ordered a pair of grips and had not put them on yet, so me without any bar ends did a two minute run to the coffee shop near me, I ended up crashing landing right on one side of my handlebars. I ended up spending 3 days at the hospital and have a lacerated liver and two broken ribs, which I now have to take a 2-6 month break from cycling depending on how it heals. I wish I had thought twice about that ride haha
Anyways thank you Seth for all the awesome videos!Love the videos sethAs some one who is from Louisiana our trails can really use the moneyNo one can create excitement like Kanye. Not even Drake can. The fact that he’s still as relevant or even more relevant at this part of his life is insane. Look at everyone from his come up era. 50, game, Jeezy, Wayne etc. He’s the only one that can still be both musically relevant and culturally relevant. To still be included in the conversation with the current generations top artist like Cole, kendrick and drake is an accomplishment that needs to be talked about.  Every year this guy tops the ranking for most anticipated project.I'm actually very excited for this album. There is no one like Kanye.Kanye is a beautiful, broken, artistic man. He’s not meant to be understood just appreciated. ❤️"When Kanye West is focused on music, not too many people better."

That part!We need this type of music. Music needs to go back to meaningful roots.DONDA has some of the best songs I’ve heard in my life; there’s one that I’m not sure the name of but when the choir vocals came in I physically jumped out of my chairKanye wants to get this album right . 
He’s going to break the internet with this piece ……one of the most anticipated projects ever period…Yes, showing the younger generation what amazing true storytelling hip hop is ! Brings me back! Loving it!That song “Jesus Lord” was EVERYTHING!!!! I was at home crying, my cats were looking at me like I was crazy 🤣🤦‍♀️I have tears coming down my eyes listening to this song. The culture needed this album!!I can't wait to HEAR THE FULL ALBUM these snippets gave me CHILLSI love how Kanye doesn’t deny his love for God. We may not be perfect human beings, but when you have a relationship with God nothing can keep you from it. #prodigalsonThis guy needs to be studied in school for all his work methods, his strategies and accomplishments. He is one of a kind!Donda is absolute fire. 🔥
All the features did a great job
Hopefully he releases it todayThat little clip of a song brought tears to my eyes! College drop out was the first rap album that taught me to LISTEN to the words... I'm extremely excited to hear this album. ❤Finally some music with meaning and purpose… much needed in 2021🙌🏾I broke into tears hearing Kanye's verse on Jesus is Lord. God shd protect Kanye and bless him bountifully, Electro and Jada also gave me goosebumpsAnyone who knows Kanye knows the potential for this album but the fact he named it after his Mother & this being the first album since his divorce,  just adds the extra excitement & sealing the deal that this ish is going to be straight 🔥🔥Im always in the mood for Kanye's musicLast night was everything I was hoping for! Ye killed it! I am praying he drops today… But I understand this project is very close to his heart.Donda will be the album hip hop has been missing since 2015🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥He had some unfinished verses on there but it was great sonically. Through everything Kanye has done in the last few years it’s crazy how his music always brings people back to him. He’s exactly who he always said he wasKanye you did that, fully focused. Electronica I feel that too.  I love Jadakiss voice with my eyes close. We needed this today.Kanye music is so powerful that it’s brought me to tears a handful of timesI’m so sad for his pain. His mother’s death broke him. I know that pain. 😢Music that touches your soul. DONDA is an instant classic. Glad I tuned into that stream. Kanye is back!🥲I love this sound for Kanye. This is an amazing record.  I know this has been so healing for him. He was the only child. I know his mom’s death changed him. 
Jennifer Hudson should write about how she changed after her family’s death as well. I think the fans will get behind that.I was at the show last night and it was amazing..this album is epic..Kanye is a musical geniusKanye never falls short when it comes to music. It’s honor to his mom, so  it’s going to beyond 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #cantwaitI lost my mom October 2019 to cancer. I’m gone relate to this album so much. Can’t wait. RIP DONDA RIP KRISTIN ❤️🕊I'm just hoping that Ye is able to have a big bounce back year. Actually rooting for the man.I can dig it.. looking forward to listening to the whole albumLord bless Ye, I'm so proud he's venting the right way... Great music coming soonSo happy for this man..we needed to hear him again!!! Kanye ft. Jay Z..I got one word.." YES "After the year Kanye had he deserves all the W'sGlad to see Hip hop won last night, But Nas King's Disease 2 is absolutely Beautiful from Front to Back🎧💯🔥Kanye is my favorite and has been. In the age of social media, people started making artist, art, be replaced with their person. I appreciate his artistry and pray for peace in his person! 🤍🙏🏾I can tell this album gone be a classic . Ye a legend forrealI can never understand why people compare Kanye to Drake, they're not alike, one is just an artist and the other is an artist and musician. Drake is a commercial artist, he gets on the best beats, has an to listen to flow and has a large following, he can't lose as lomg as he sticks to the formula. Kanye is up there with Michael Jackson as he not only could create music and try different sounds, but the star as wellI ain’t gone lie I’m sitting patiently waiting for “DONDA”🙇🏾‍♀️… He is a musical genius….he just need Gods love and guidance and I’m praying for him🙏🏾Good point Charlemagne Da God made about ‘Ye having the culture in the palm of his hands.....these snippets of “Donda” are incredible 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"Genius gone clueless" I felt that!! He's literally an ARTIST!!I'm ready for this Album... this is going to be a beautiful work of art. Kaynes verse almost made me shed a tear and thats only the snippet. R.I.P. MaWe must give him his flowers while he’s still alive. This man is goated!!The samples are 🔥 🔥🔥 I haven’t bought a Kanye record since College Dropout. I’m gonna go get this. ☝🏽Look at any artist that came up early 2000s, ye has unmatched longevity- not even drake could have this hype. Ye is unstoppable and incredible 🙏 Donda the AOTY - Rest In PeaceYe actually hasn’t said a word in months, I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t release this album. It’s so personal to him, I respect the fact he would only want to play it for fans but not sell it.“ I don’t count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs.” Jadakiss got

Got everyone talking about God too.Are you guys enjoying the new AUT release?
Sakuya is from a portals that randomly spawn and then you do a quest to get a watch which you use modeless.
Gojo is on the mountain near the arena, you need lots of cash for him.
Reaper needs two death notes that spawn randomly.
Sol is from killing Dio with Star Platinum and doing the quest of the NPC that spawns (it's broken right now)

5:27- The EndShort video, concise, very good instructions, probably the best AUT video ever.Just a heads up, from what I experienced, most quest stands, Noc, Sol, TWOH and a few others are currently bugged, you cannot get them if you finish the quests.. with the only exception being the Alternate Universe stands and The World.Hey I was spawning in stands just to see what I'd find and I got the custom PLANET//SHAPER which was pretty cool. Im sure there are very rare stands you can get from the arrows.Hey I noticed some things that are wrong in the video
1. The dawn boss is dio (idk if you were referring to him or not)
2. You get TWOH quest from talking to puchie with TW equipped 
Bonus. The guest you said was TWOH is noctorus and that’s the red/black TW on one of the front page thingys. And sol (the blue/black SP) is the nemesis of nocturus. And you get all from using SP and killing dio then sol will appear and you say yes and do the questto add on to this video, p//s is obtainable via arrow, although it's probably very rare as it took me a while to get it.

sorry for the misunderstanding. the trello came back for a bit, and as it turns out, you still need to get the effect and then summon crystallized to get it. so i must have gotten it without knowing and gotten crystallized. oopsIf anybody is asking where to get sakuya spec to get sakuya spec find a portal which is where sakuya herself gives u a quest, now its a chance of spawn yes its  18% with 600 secThanks! I thought you got TW from arrows and I used like 4 arrows until someone told me so I watched your vid and it really helped me out!There two stands that where not mentioned, twau (They call it the world high voltage) you get it by using the saints eye on shadow the world. And the second one is (don't know what it is called) a person holding knifes an a clock, they can stop time, the way you get it is, by finding a portal and a npc will give you a quest to use every time move (ts, te, and btd)Good Guide mate. Keep up the good work. It helped alotupdate:there is no dawn boss anymore so you have to find tale of the universe by finding chest give it to an npc and complete a quest to get dawn

extra:if you want to find chests quickly get king crimson whenever you use time erase it will remove al buildings so you can see where the chests aredawn actually needs a book called the tales of the universe, and talk to the person near the dawn sword (not DIO) and he'll give a quest for the dawn sword and you can pull dawn out after completing the questi got planet shaper from an arrow
also useful tip is using x chara in devils palmfor the low cd heal, or you could use star platinums heal tooYou can also get dragon balls from chests by a very rare chance I got one from a chest recentlyFor the mounds jus use time erase and itll make all of it clear so no sand blocking ir vision after u uss eraseThe strongest stand as right now is Xeno,its broken not as in strong hut it can break peoples stand by using the grab move so they cant attackOne more thing to note
Using cursed orb on shadow dio does nothing,since it seems that cursed orb itself is broken.For gojo you have to find him and do his quest to start the quest it takes 125k but the tasks are pretty easyu don't need to fight a boss for the dawn sword, just complete the quest after u got the tales of the universe itemjust so people know,
nocturnus =/ twoh
nocturnus = dio's the world
it doesn't have time stop and is orange.
to get twoh you need to talk to Pucci and get the quest (second option when chatting with him)Got shadow tw on first arrow, and found cursed orb on first chestYou use cursed orb on sptw to get stwr btw and also u dont have to be standless to get dawn sword u can pull it out with any stand but it will replace the stand u have equippedDoes the dawn boss actually spawn or do you have to do something else?Wondering, if I would of done the nucturnus quest, the last quest was 1v1's. What will happen? 
Would it make my tw into nucturnus or I need the stand equip on 1v1?
(Im confused since im using another stand and I don't want my hard work go in vein)I’ve gotten a cursed orb for the first time I’ve played this and so I gave it to my friend as a gift since I’m nice :)You can get PLANET // SHAPER from stand arrow but the chances is very lowU can get Planet Shaper on arrows too.you can also get killer queen from arrows don’t forgetI used the cursed orb on shadow dio like you said, it took the orb, but i still have shadow dio :(I joined in to see my stand storage empty I had so many rare stands with extreme hard items I had collected on the previous game. Smh all my hard work goneThere's 1 more stand that isn't fully done but obtainable u need crystallized and just open asteroids with crystallized and you have a random chance of getting planet shaperAlso the normal arrows have a chance to give planet shaperI joined it the moment it was released.
I lost all my stands besides moce, csspr, and sans but moce broke (also rip my drip goku and my portal orb)Imma assume that the souls and any other items can be obtained from chestCan someone list all the obtainable stands currently because i feel like there are a few missingI remember in old aut when you had to walk around the map and hope the heart you needed would spawn to get gasterI’ve been grinding for kc and I’ve used 3 arrows. I have one in my bank so I got 2 Ge and 1 spI still have no idea how but I got planet shaper while running around with crystalized. Does anyone know how this happened?Hey
Thanks for this!
I never played this game before but have been planning on playingThis was so helpfulFinally a good shindo YouTuber playing other games than shindoI got conflicting info here and I wanna make it clear: Do you get P//S from arrows or by interacting with a meteor after getting a "cristallized" effect from them?I have a question for Goku spec :
When you do the quest, Shenron appears and tell you what IS your wish, what are the choices and what does they do ? (i already know that power IS used for Goku spec)You can also get planet shaper from an arrowI have a question can I revert my stand back to its first form because I don't like the way I evolved it and id like it back to its original formI got gaster before the big update but they removed the awakening :(when i used cursed orb on stw i didnt get stwr it just remained the samedo arrows and meteors despawn? if they do how long do they stay for before despawning?in the devils palm, do you need a specific stand to get items out of the sand search areas? because i’m interacting with it, and i never get anything from it.there is also the world high voltage that can be obtainable in funny valentine's dimension and using an eye of the saintBut what about the black purple portal that I entered, it took me to a big room with glowing walls and an NPC asking me if I wanted to manipulate time at my will?I used a cursed orb on shadow dio it did the animation and it just stayed as shadow dio"This is such a cool jojo ability"
*proceed to charges up a kamehameha*Man's got 60k subs and is 19th on trending.
Well done man :DIs it worth keeping Crystallized and nuclear star?I used cursed orb on shadow dio and it just deleted the cursed orb from my inventory without giving me stwrTWOH is obtain'd via pucci's quest or by finding a DIO Diary.. Not the Nocturnus Quest, which gives you NocturnusPlanet Shaper is also a arrow standim so happy to be back in that game i have video of it 9 months ago im OG player of it..Yeah man theres some stands that u actually forgot to add and stwr isnt stw + cursed orb , its sptw + cursed orb ( i checked the trello before it died)hint: sans does not take damage from the devils palm so it can just stand there waiting for debris to spawnFor some reason, one of the stand was not in my inventory. I only got p//s and others I got. I feel like mine is a glitchI need to correct you.
There isnt a dawn boss, you need to do a quest, you need Tales Of The Universe though.
Dio doesnt give twoh, Pucci does, Dio gives Nocturnusi used a dios bone on my white snake but the bone just disappeared and i didn't count for the quest"Hat is a rare chance of spawning " me who got it in a chest on my like 4th openHey, was wondering how to get TWOH, i did the quest but once i clicked the dio diary that appeared (after task completed) it disappear and nothing happened
If you could find a solution, would be nice from you, as i didn't see any video about that
Anyway, that was a good vid!i used the Cursed Orb on STW, but i didnt get STWR, is that a bug or is now with probs?thanks for the guide.wonder what would happen if i did the shadow dio quest with shadow legsDoes anyone know the location of the dawn boss??? I've looked all over the map and haven't found him*Yes yes yes yes* YES! I was waiting for this game! :Dfun fact: if you go into devil's palm with sans you don't lose stamina or health. i hope this is intentionalIf the quest requires 1v1 Gamemode just say 'can i have free win', works everytime.I love how i randomly got sans back.Man when i was farming kills for over heaven when i was done then the 40 kills go reseted so i rejointedI used cursed orb on shadow dio and my cursed orb disappeared and i still had shadow dioi was doing the sol quest and got help from my friends and everything just to find out its broken smhJust got cmoon a few mintes ago and had to go off, i’m very excited to get mih tmrw and hopefully alot more like gojo and sptwR.I.P  Zenith 

You will be Missed a lotsHow do you get up on the moutain?how do Isuck blood with shadow dio? The moveset on the wiki says its B, but B is counter so idk how to finish the quest for the world. Can someone explain?Just some info to new players: Private servers DO NOT load you into the game basically just a scamI've played aut for hours but never noticed the shop, I feel stupidhi i have a question, i completed johnny’s mission on release yesterday, and now i still have act 1 and johnny keeps telling me to come back to him when i have act 3. should i just remove my current act 1 and try to get the mission again?Great video, but i think you missed how to get the world: HIGH VOLTAGE? or is it unob as of the revamp?\bro dawn boss doesnt spawn u can get dawn item from chest with small chancefun fact: you can get p//s from arrow its just hella rareI remember when things were easierNow that's my boy Jay making JoJo content, amazing sensation nglI apreciat you more and more variety :)Dawn sword quest : Kill dio 1 time, Obtain 15,000 Ucoins, Inflict 25,000 DMG
You dont get the world over heaven by talking to dio, you get over heaven by talking to pucci with the world.#22 on trending, congrats Jay!The way he says sans is both funny and cursedI used a cursed orb on shadow dio and didn't do anything and I lost my cursed orb.This helps when your not stuck on the data loading screen and when you get in it just kicks you out and your up all night trying to play a 3D lego game...Actually you don’t talk to DIO to get the world over heaven (that was nocturnus quest) to get the world over heaven you need to get the world then use a DIO diaryWhy can't I summon my spova? Do I have to get the updated 1 or the odl 1 still works?Stwr might be bugged I used the cursed orb with shadow dio and nothing happened i just lost the orbFINALLY A GAME THAT I'M BETTER THAN JAY INOnly Tyron could turn everyone into a Colby fan.Never thought I'd ever be rooting for Colby, but here we are.You can see the hidden rage inside of Covington 😂Let’s go CovingtonDamn. I got freaking goosebumps when Covington and Woodley finally faced off. I’m more excited for tomorrow’s main card then I am for the pay-per-view card next weekendThe losses on Tyrone’s record are due to racism.  🤣Finally get to see Woodley vs Colby after all these yearsColby looks in unreal shape!!Damn Tyron went full victim for this fightLMAO COLBYS FACE, when he reads Woodleys t-shirt is priceless, he's trying hard not to burst out laughing.Rooting for Colby. So freaking hard. His last fights where mindblowing. Keep fighting with a broken jaw and still make a total strikes record. Come on. Let’s go man.Made me a Covington fan with that shirt. SMHEven Dana is rooting for Colby on this one!Colby looks huge standing next to woodley! Didn’t realize he was that much biggerFirst time I’m gonna root for Colby. Actually rooted for Twood in the past but that shits over.Tyron's main problem is that he's risk averse, and the only thing that overcomes fear is anger.  While it is generally not advisable to be angry in a high-level MMA contest, for Tyron Woodley, that might just be what he needs to get him going.  The man is a mass of seriously untapped potential.This could’ve easily been PPV 💯 Can’t wait!Just based on that stupid t-shirt that he's wearing, I'd love to see Tyron Woodley lose big.Colby looking focused like a hawk
Tyron looking like he needs help3:00 Tough to root for Tyron after the way he handled the press conference, but I am rooting for the guy. I hope this fight gets his focus right and the man becomes a force in the WW division again. Let’s go Woodley!Tyron out there trying to divide whatever little fan base he has leftThe legend goes that Tyron Woodley pulling the race card to this day"Legalize being black" I don't know if Tyrons doing that on purpose to provocate just like Colby or he's being seriousThat kid's so damned happy to be fighting Cowboy.  I love it.  I hope they have a great match.  
That's what this sport is all about.  A true martial artist is happy to be fighting a good opponent and they give them all respect.Colby wants people to hate him, everyone loves him. Tyron wants people to love him, everyone hates him. Best sport ever lolTyron is gonna need all of that woke energy after Colby put him to sleep 😴Still gobsmacked how insane this card is, and Dana being here somehow makes the buildup much better.Tyrone looks like he'd rather been at home in his studio than fighting. Colby already won.If Colby wins, he would be remembered as the man who ended Woodley's career as a fighterTyron “ I lost because of racism” Woodley.First time I've ever wanted Colby to winColby has bad intentions like never before. That stone cold gaze while Ty-Quil hides behind his shades.colby seems like the type of guy who would work his ass off after his usman loss and come back even better.  he looks really good.  outside woodley catching covington with that one big punch there is no way he can out work colby and win this.  the way woodley backs up to the cage in every fight is gonna play perfectly into colby's hands.Damn never realized how much taller Colby was lol first time these dudes stood next to each other in a long timeI’m not a Colby fan but I gotta say he looked like a badass at that face offColby is meant to be the heel but we're all routing for him.Tyrone just made me a Colby fan for this fight...Woodley has had a rough last 2 fights and Colby is the favorite in this fight BUT I notice Colby has been a lot more humbled and quiet when talking about Woodley. Maybe some of what Woodley was saying before was true. 👀Can’t wait for this fight!damn dana was so nervous before tyron and colby came on, like he thought they were gonna start going at it on stageMan i wonder if its even possible that Woodley survive a defeat against Colby, make me almost want to root for the guy lol .I just have a feeling Tyron Woodley is gonna shock the world.😲😲😲this a good ass fight nightGoddamn Colby looked like he was staring Tyron right in the soulBig fight for Jonny Walker.  Legacy and career defining fights for Woodly and Covington.  Great card 👊🏼“Legalize being black”??? What is that message lmaoIt's been a bit of a long time coming but it's great that we get to see Woodley vs Covington. Would have been a bigger fight a few years back when Woodley was champion but still great that we get to see it now.Tyron pulled off the impossible. 




He made me root for Colby!Colby looks so on point, he’s either putting T-Wood out of business or he’s never gonna live down the embarrassment.Only a genius like Tyrone can come up with a shirt like that 🤣🤣🤣Congrats to twood for getting a 4th degree black belt in playing the race cardHated Covington but after Woodleys stupid BLM matters to every question made me hate him more. Lets go Chaos!More excited about this event than alot of previous actual ufc cardsI don't know why but I find it hilarious when Dana is stressing and getting in between fighters 🤣Love how everyone walks off stage in the wrong directionWoodley doesn't ever disappoint (in being disappointing)Who would honestly be surprised if Tyquil pulls out in the next few hours?3:09 Niiiice! Get him Colby 🏆🥇♥️Gonna be a great fight and hopefully we will here joe Rohan y’all about the perfect performanceColby in phenomenal shape as usualTyron "The Victim One" WoodleyEvery fight is an absolute banger. Price looked in great shape. Coby too.Woodley is salty that Dana is rooting for trump unlike other sports organisations lol.Colby ain't playing and joking this time around... Damn I'm excited for him to retire Tyquil!straight up i'd be so scared of colby. dude is a savageCovington looks ready to go!"Tyron woodley one more sleep" sounded like he was talking about Tyron's performanceHate him or love him, Woodley can be a beast. If this guy comes out at his best we will have a hell of a show people.Tyron woodley has people cheering for Colby convingtionColby is much bigger than I used to give him credit for ; this is going to be a fun night of fights !Colby looked really lean but I don't guess there is ever a question about him being in shape.Can’t wait to see the post fight photo of Price and cowboy getting a beer. They seem like dope dudesDana is always the highlight of the showdownsTruth is I'm rooting for Woodley but I kinda like how serious Colby looks. He ain't talking anymore which means he's about to handle business.Tyrone ‘the victim’ Woodley🇺🇸Lets go Colby🇺🇸The sound tyron made when he quit still makes me laugh1:13 Dana using the force.Woodley actually forced me to become a Colby fan for a dayTyrone Woodley is gonna get embarrassed. I dont really like Colby but he has crazy staminaDana @ 2:14 saying “watch those two” lol 😂when colby is the understated one you know the world has gone madI like when they left the faceoffs in different directions. UFC should have some way to arrange this.I still can’t believe i have no choice than to support Colby Covington 🤦‍♂️ 😭WOOOF. THAT WAS INTENSE! CANT WAITColby looks focused boy! Ain’t jawin like he was at Marty. Gonna be a good one!If you look closely at 1:15 you can see dana white sprinkle a lil bit of magic on the Johnny Walker fight lmfao Im excited as shit!I WAS rooting for woodley until this... Go colby!Just a friendly reminder Colby already fought Woodley in a wrestling match. Colby beat the crap out of him btw.Colby made the face off looks intense🔥, GO COLBYYYi feel like johnny will murk his opponent to prove a point. he seemed way more composed here than in the past.. im fucking hyped for this cardIts all funny and games for Tyron and Colby until Usman enters the chat 😁😁Tyron look like hes about to cry. Already lost this oneIm actually worried for Colby, he hasnt done nearly enough thrash talking for this oneI know Colby definitely has the leg up but i deeply want to see Woodly Succeed.Damn, Colby looks in excellent shape.Cant say that im a Colby fan but i think its gonna go just like the Lawler fight when we kept waiting for Robbie to unload but ultimately Colby's pressure is too much and the fight wont be close at allGerald coming with that double leg shortly followed by submission.I definitely got Colby winning this one. If woodley pulls this off I will be shocked!!Colby vs Tyrone is going to be iconicTyron he's got a come out the same like in the Darren Till fight, serious and committedWoodley already looks like he doesnt wanna be there lolStaring each other in anger and walking after him lol❤😂😂This is Woodley's swan song.  He knew in the beginning this was a terrible matchup for him, but it's the biggest fight he can get right now without taking a crazy amount of damage.  Colby is going to outwork him for 5 rounds, but he won't finish him.  I don't see a universe where Woodley wins this fight, being completely unbiased.Let’s go Colby never thought I’d say thatI really want to hear what will Coby say after he won the fightI really think they are trying to get rid of Woodley. This is the second time he has fought in the past few months without the embedded feature( last time against burns their was little promo,) and both cards have been absolutely stacked. After seeing his shirt, I do not blame them.Tyrone "Black Tantrums Matter" Woodley is just terrible.I'm excited to see  Colby fight againColby looks in good shape like never before.Colby seems different for this fight. This is either gonna be the best Colby or worst. Either way I want him to winNiko is funny as hell 😂McKenzie didn’t need a translator 😂I'm all in for Colby on this one, hope he beats twood up."Legalize Being Black"...🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😆😅🤣😂
The Irony of him saying he can't breathe after the fight just made everything that much more silly!!! IMHO🔥🇺🇸🦅💯dana white reaction to niko price is PRICELESSSI wanted Woodley to win, but after the presser yesterday, I'm rooting for Colby.Have been a huge fan of T Wood since he defeated one of my favs in 'Ruthless' Robbie Lawler. Not sure who will win this one. Wanna say Colby looking at Woodley's last 2 performances but not writing him off like alot of people are doing right now.

Good luck both fighters, hope it to be a good fight😃Not gonna lie I think Gerald is looking good. He's definitely taking this fight really seriously....and the main attraction of the evening...Dana's gigantic biceps 💪 💪 💪Colby physique is on pointSeeing them size up i didn't realize Colby was that big compared to Tyron. This could be the end of the road for Tyron.Let's go Colby Covington. Batter tyron into retirement.Wow Dern actually looking good with her weight now. Being in the UFC with better nutritionists has definitely helped her a lot with thatGreat card!  Let's go Colby!!!!!We all remember what happened last time Johnny Walker was acting all silly at the face offs😵Damn didn't realize how much bigger Colby is than tyron. Tyron might go to sleep in this oneI hope they both perform to the best of their abilities then leave the cage with respect for themselves and each other.this is one fight i hope colby wins very convincingly.Dana is 5’11 and is clearly taller than Colby. He’s hunched over a tad during the face off, but you can see it during the walk up. 

Like I said, took a pic with Colby and I know heights when I see them. Colby 5’10 tops.This fight is simple to call. IF Tyron lands that devastating right hand he’ll win via stoppage. However it’s more likely that Colby and his team are aware and will grapple consistently at angles and circle to Tyron’s left hand. I expect an easy UD for Colby but we’ll see.Colby looks ready and focused. Should be interesting. 
Hopefully Tyron doesn't fall asleep this time around.Colby is probably going to take the W which hurts me to say lol. However, if Tyron fights how he fought against Till by staying in the centre of the cage and trading then i believe his power will be too much for Colby and he might catch him. Surely after losing 10 straight rounds he realises his technique of backing up to the fence and exploding isnt working.Glad the title says “finally” face off because it’s true. Finally.Tyron falling in and out of directions tooI didn't realize coby was taller than him until nowWoodley's shirt is making me falling in and out of lovePeople hating on Chamaev but dude has been fighting between Middleweight and Welterweight and has been very active. That’s impressiveNotice how Dana is holding back COLBY 




🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣i think this is the first time i want colby to win LOLWould be funny if Colby uses  Woodley " I'm falling in and out of love with you " track as his walk out songGoing to be an awesome fightThis could easily be a PPVNever seen Colby be so quiet, feels so weird.Every time I see Woodley face off with someone I'm shocked by how small he is. I get that he's jacked but dude has a small frame for the division.W....T.....F.......does Woodley's shirt supposed to imply?! Lmao. I can already hear the victimhood cries from him.Khamzat looking like he’s ready for burglary 😂colby is no games this fight. He's going to wash woody's virtue signaling tearsTwood still has a nasty overhand right. But Colby’s chin has never failed him before. It’s going to be nerve wrecking the first minutes until either Colby puts the pressure or Twood lands a bomb and Colby takes it fineI’ve never been more excited for a non-paperview event.Honestly, colby got the eye of the tiger goin onHope Woolley makes a come backThought Colby might bitchslap woodley right then and there.
Let's go King of Brazil!I never knew Tyron was that much shorter that Colby.I'm rooting for Woodley as a Masvidal fan!Everybody sleeping on Woodley and forgot, he knocks people out cold for stepping forwardI'm OUT of love with this 1😢Meerschaert didn't want to follow Chimaev off the same side of the stage. Bad news if he's scared of him even before they start fightColby’s about to put a beat down on himColby looking like he wants all that smoke.. Damn its going to a beast of a battle. Wonder if Tyron going to show up?????Colby talking all that shit, now he wanna be quiet 😂😂😂Call me crazy but I feel like Woodley is going to know Colby out man fr frThis is ppv caliber card.
UFC is 🔥..... my favorite sport since covidTryon didn't win his race, but he's going to win the race.Tyron probably felt that Trump energy from Colby and DanaWon’t lie Chimaev is a scary dude haha 😂If Woodley has his head on right he’ll win this fight. If not, it’s gonna be a long night for himTyron looked afraid to go the same way as Colby. It's going to be funny when he gets smashed after talking all that smokeWould be 🔥 if Colby came out to 1980’s Hulk Hogan Song “I Am A Real American”! Would be SIKK!!!Dana White looks so stressed out each time he has to do these. He’s just hoping so hard none of them lose their shit before the fight lolHope Colby uses the Kurt Angle musicYo Woodley selling the fight on a whole nother levelThis fight was embarassing for woodley he literally did this to himselfI really want Colby to win but I just got that feeling that tyron is going to throw right and connect at some point. Colby has better endurance and pace but tyron can sleep you if he lands that overhand. I hope colby just smothers him, puts him on the cage and beats him down.Tyron playing the victim before the fight, but he's really gonna be one after the fight!Awesome fights 💪Colby looks serious1:50 it's like Dana is gently pushing away a lion then patting it on he back for letting him.Heh, at least Colby shook Dana's hand this timeWoodly can't understand why he has no fans. Every time he opens his mouth he is talking about racism.One thing I noticed is whom Dana is closed with he usually blocks themWoodley stop trying to Be the Colin Kaepernick of MMA 😒Woodly always pandering and playing victim. He’s always the first one to even mention race. I’m so tired of this.I was expecting the weigh ins to have a lil more drama! All good tho should be some killer fightsNever cared for Colby much but he earns my respect for not wearing a face mask.

Cowboy isn't a sheep either :)I see colby doing to Tyron the same thing Marty did to him ....dominating himDana's face as Anik says 'Super Middleweight' ... 0:00That look Spann gave Walker was almost Fedor like, Spann could get the better of him and Walker might be getting his walking papersDamn i wanna like Tyron but the shirts he be wearing and shit he be saying I just can't get behind. Going for ColbyI think Colby will win, but he definitely lost that staredown ( mentally).Damn woodley has other shit on his mind he’s not the same anymoreBe honest you didn't know Colby was taller then Woodley.Tyron with the shades on. He shookDana is definitely skipping leg day 🤣Colby looks 2-3 inches taller than the "The Victim One"I’ve never seen Colby that focused b4I been saying it day 1. Nico Price looks juiced asf. Those delts alone are a gift from the gods. His physique is highly underratedLET'S GO, SO HYPED!!!How many obstacles do you want in Chloe-Lucifer relationship ? 

Writers: “Yes.”literally can't waitThis show should never end. All of the actors have so much talent. I have laughed, cried, and enjoyed so much. I don't think there is any other show I have enjoyed as much. It will be truly missed.When they were revealing the god character , I was hoping it would be Morgan Freeman. But this guy works well too.I am so glad that Lucifer is on Netflix. Netflix made it 100 times better. Every season gets better. This season was amazing!"If I ever said those three words to you, it would be a lie" why no one is talking about that ? they deserve a happy ending come onChloe: "alright alright he's the devil I'm okay with it now"
Lucifer: "im *GOD* now!"“If i ever said those 3 words to you, it would be a lie.”

*Dude that hurts* 💔I loved this serial so much and I don't want it to end, I wish this wonderful drama that lasted for 5 seasons never ends. You have a great team, the actors are great, the psychology is included in the series, the music of the series is magnificent, the songs we listen to from Tom Ellis, everything is perfect. Congratulation👏👏👏I want unlimited seasons of Lucifer series because I'm addicted to this like hell 🔥🔥I just binged s5b and I came back here to let ya'll know what an emotional roller-coaster that was. My wig, my life, my whole existence is SNATCHED. Loved the storyline and excellent acting as usual. Thank you netflix 🙏🏻❤️ now imma go sit in a corner and wonder what to do with my life.... 😶I love that Chloe is not afraid to call God out lolI never want this show to end...Honestly, I wait when Ella and God meet, that will be awkwardly good.What a season it was, finished in less than a day! A rollercoaster of emotion and don’t regret a thing ! BeautifulChloe : You're a terrible father
chloe again
 : respectfullyPart 2 was amazing!!!!! Many are hating on the musical episode, but I loved that they gave the musical episode a fun reason. It revealed a different side of God and made it really interesting to watch. And how they sorta brought it back in the last ep with Can't Touch This. Lol
So excited to see how this story will go in the final season. Sad to say goodbye but happy that the team got to wrap this up the way they wanted to. Hope we won't have to wait too long for season 6!Chloe Decker: "You are a terrible father."
*Stares at God with a straight face for a second*
Chloe Decker: "Respectfully."
*After she remembers who she's talking to*Netflix did a hell of a job by renewing Lucifer i cant even imagine what they would do if they decided to reboot or renew ConstantineI love how God and lucifer have that father and son moment. "So, where is your desk? He has a desk. Maybe one day, when you work hard enough, you might one day rise to this man's level." Every asian parent kid conversion ever.finally i have just finished part-2 for whom i was eagerly waiting...............i must actually i am obliged to say ------------------it was a goosebump................I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN THIS KIND OF WEB SERIES BEFORE THIS..................THIS IS THE BEST WEB SERIES IN THE WORLD I HAVE EVER SEEN..........................................................I  cried at climax...................I AM WAITING  N I WILL WAIT FOR NEXT EPISODES...........................NO ONE CAN ACT LIKE TOM ELLIS ........................I AM FEELING SAD..........PLEASE RELEASE OTHER EPISODES ..........................Luci and Daniel drinking together... that made my dayLucifer is the only web series that i never want to be ended.Ok but like I wanna see Trixie and God in a scene and see how it plays out
Looks like I got what I wanted! That scene was just too cute thoSuch a great series, and even though it was saved twice, to now give us a Season 6, it doesn't seem like they are willing to go beyond that, but hopefully, they will at least wrap up all the loose ends by the time Season 6 is over.God's voice actually fits him wowLast episode absolutely broke me. I cried so much. 'Lucifer' is by far my favorite show now, and I cannot wait for season 6. I'll be sad for it to be over, though. I'm bad with endings.I have watched all the episodes of 5b. It was the best seizoen yet. What a masterpeaceLucifer is the only web series in the world that never deserves  to be end .... please God make this web series forever long 🙏🏻❤️Ella: “Awww, dad joke! Nice”
Lucifer: “Thanks, I’m practicing.”
Chloe: 👁👄👁Tell me about it.  I didn’t sleep 10 hours to watch this whole. Series. Can’t wait for season 6.. I love this . Especially lucifer being lucifer  Dan  being annnoying but silly, Chloe being detective , Ella being so positive and happy. Everyone did great. Lucifer and Chleo have a great chemistryI can't remember the last time I was this excited for a show, actually I don't think I've ever been this excited for a show omfgggg I cannot WAIT. I am literally anxious to see what direction they take this in. Bad enough the devil already fell in love, I am expecting both the worst and the best!Omg....this season is just fantastic...they never disappoints 😍😍😍.i just can't wait for season6 now🤩🤩🤩🤩"I think it's time lucifer... Time for me to retire."

Am I the only one who shouted on the top of their lungs "OHHHH SHIT LUCIFER IS GOING TO TAKE GOD'S PLACE!" or am I just a huge fanatic of this masterpiece of a series! 😈😈I went from laughing at this show of how ridiculous it was when I first heard about it, to now it has become one of my all time favorite series.   My god the musical episode was so damn good.I love how chole has the balls to tell GOD he's a horrible dad.. I have a big mouth but I would most definitely watch it around himcouldnt be more hyped, seems like the best seasonLet's be honest, Mazikeen's character and personality is one of the best things about the entire show.This show should never endThis is amazing! This show should never end! Please, Netflix, the show has been amazing, and you did a great job with picking it up! Please continue!Lucifer sitting as far away from Michael as physically possible at the dinner table is honestly a whole moodLucifer making a dad joke, Dan rolling his eyes and Lucifer giving him a cheeky "and what?" grin gives me lifeLucifer was told by his father that he should aim to be like Dan...
Does God just WANT Lucifer to hate him?I have been crying 4 seasons now CAN'T I JUST SEE THEM BE TOGETHERThe best of the best season 🔥
Can't wait to watch more 
Tom Ellis really nailed the character lucifer  😍I really love this show and i can't wait for the next season. 
I'm dying to know what will happenMaze did a beautiful job I must of watched that scene like 30 times when she screams in that language to fight in war chillsI am so waiting to see whether Ella would finally figure out Lucifer is the "Lucifer".i never thought i'd watch a series based on love. This is pure class.Everyone: debating about what will happen to deckerstar 
Me: wondering what’s going to happen to Trixie and CharlieIf all the apples are bad. Maybe it's the tree that's the problem.

- Lucifer said it to GOD -Who else loved the scene at the end of 5x10? 😘😭😭😭😭😭This has been the best show of my life. It well be a sad day when this show ends. I have cried, laughed,  and watched 100 plus times.Ella: “Awww dad joke - niceee“
Lucifer: “Thanks, I’m practicing”
Chloe: *stares at Luci*

i love it 😭✨"I am going to be god " probably the best part of this trailerSo we just gonna ignore the fact that Lucifer said he was practing his dad jokes and Linda being arrested ✿What a brilliant web series  I have ever seen. Waiting for season 6.If Chloe and Lucifee didn't end up together, I will be madddd!!!I don't want this show to end! 😣I just wanna see Ella's reaction when they tell her he's really Lucifer.Linda is like a teacher who can make you to pass your exam but couldn't her own surprise test...LMAOThe funeral was the saddest thing ever. I cried so much when Lucifer and Ella started singing.Everyone is obsessed over the shipping, I'm just hyped over seeing this celestial stuff.Ella: “dad joke nice”

Lucifer: “I’m practicing” 😳😳🤔🤔I came here after watching all the latest episode I literally cried a lot in the last episode  it was really heartbreaking ...I m just leaving this comment here so that this will last forever .....
Chole ❤️ Lucifer forever 🌎
And one more request we need more episodes soon please Netflix 🥺🌎💔They went from lucifer smoking weed on a horse to lucifer saying "I'm going to be God". Well that sounds about right 👍Trixie has really grown!
So adorable!
Great Series!Chloe: you are a terrible farther
God: stares😳😳
Chloe: ... Respectfully 😟Just one more week....feeling excited!! The only bad thing is I’ll probably watch all 8 episodes in a day or 2 & then I’ll have to wait at least a year till season 6 comes out!2 more days can’t wait

Gotta say the most emotional and greatest part In the whole seriesBang up job on Season 5, Netflix. Some of the best episodes of the entire series.Lucifer and dan drinking together is a sight you would only see in heaven
Edit:I didn’t expect this many likes and this is my first time getting more than 500 likes so I feel like I’ve accomplished something in life
Edit 2:just watched the episode and wow that episode is a straight banger y’all need to watch it if you have NetflixOmg the 28th...it's so close, yet so far. I just have to thank Netflix again, the fans fought so hard for this show and the characters, and what you've done with it is much better than Fox could've ever dreamed of, or were willing to invest in. Even though it's ending, at least they'll give the DeckerStar gang a proper send off 🥰🙏😍 y'all seriously could just go ahead and give us the season tho.....Love this series♥️👌Repeatedly watched the last episode ending 15 times! Damn that was so nice!🔥The end where he said to Chloe if he said those 3 words to her it would be a lie kind of broke my heart.this entire season was riding on the all state mans performance as god. and he KILLED IT“You are a terrible father... respectfully”, Hands down, Chloe is the bravest.I love this show 😻😻😻My Reactions for this will begin a week after they air! Can't wait to experience the rest of this season along with you all!!!this show should just stay a thing the cast is so organicThe most awaited series❤️❤️Season 5 part 2 was phenomenal. Im at a loss of words, this whole season was such an emotional rollercoaster. I laughed, cried, got annoyed, felt every human emotion ever. Part A focussed more on Deckerstar, But in Part B, other important relationships and meetings were highlighted. It is the best season ever! Lucifer is by far, the best series i have ever watched. The humour, characterization, plotlines, all appealed to me, but most importantly, As lucifer morningstar evolved in the course of the series, I evolved too. Lucifer is not just a show to me, its a journey I lived to find out more about myself. I could relate to Lucifer on several counts. He made a breakthrough in one of his therapy sessions that he hated himself. I hated myself too. He blamed himself for the sins that humanity commited though he has no control over it. I blamed myself for the sins I committed that I have no control over now. He thinks that he is incapable of love, not worthy of Chloe's love, which is exactly how i felt about myself too, unworthy of the love of my loved ones, and completely useless. But seeing Lucifer from a third person POV, you realise how Lucifer is the only one worthy of Chloe's love because of the lengths he would go to protect her, how he is precious to everyone he loves, Amenadiel, Charlie, Linda, Maze, Trixie and even Dan, he loves all of them wholeheartedly and would readily sacrifice himself for them. I too am worthy of the love I get, I am precious to the people around me. We underestimate ourselves just like Lucifer when it comes to loving ourself and others. Lucifer's devil face is a result of how he sees himself as, an embodiment of evil, and Lucifer is anything but evil. He had been misunderstood since the beginning of time and had been portrayed evil and malicious in holy texts. I too, saw myself as the Devil. But when Lucifer forgave himself and let go of his guilt, his devil face and wings receded. I realised I must forgive myself too for being so harsh on myself and feeling guilty for all the sins i committed. That I deserve some self love to bring out the angel that resides within the devil in me. Lucifer gave me hope that I can be a better person than I am, that I can change for the better. He taught me to always tell the truth no matter how bitter it is.Ella taught me how everyone has darkness in them, and it is important to accept it and let the brightness in us shine. Because the darker the darkness, the brighter the light. She also taught me to have faith in the big guy even in hopeless times. Maze taught me how love can make you weak but also more stronger than you think. Amenadiel taught me to look at everything from a positive, unique perspective. Linda taught me to confront my emotions and admit them, rather than trying to conceal them. Dan thought me how life can pull you down, but its upto you whether you choose to stay down or pull yourself up. Chloe taught me to believe in myself and my capabilities no matter how hard people try to make me doubt them. God taught me how nothing lasts forever. Trixie taught me to be optimistic in the darkest of times. Every character in Lucifer teaches an important lesson. This series made me wanna be a better person, and that says a lot about it. Im proud to call myself a lucifan. I watched all 5 seasons with such enthusiasm that i cannot wait for season 6. I am disheartened that i completed watching the 5 seasons, and wont be able to watch anything new in lucifer for another year, i think. I thank the makers of lucifer for creating such a beautiful show. Lucifer has left a deep impact on me and helped shape me into a better person. I hope it changes you too❤️ 
P.S- Deckerstar redefine love in their own way. I hope we see a new phase of their relationship and life together as Mr. and Mrs. G and get a happily ever after.Lucifer : "I'm going to be God!"
Me: "oh shit here we go again"My favorite show of all time😍I think I have an idea of where this is going to go. And I LOVE it. So excited.This was EPIC!!! Season 6, I cant wait!Looks like it is going to be the best season ❤ and it should be longer also 😅I am glad that Lucifer is on Netflix now, it's becoming so epicI like how Tom Ellis is the protagonist and the antagonist at the same time 😂I liked that this show was inserting some theological/mythical elements in normal daily lives without running into universe-size battle of good vs. evil, but a complicated love and growth story for the ruler of  hell and his loyal companion. It seems like they are making a 180 turn with this second half of the season, I'll have to wait and see if they can run this story without ruining everything they have built.
The thing I really enjoyed is on 1:42 when it seems like Maze if finally reunited with Eve. (Although I have to admit, Chole telling God he is a terrible father was very ballsy)I am so excited thank you for the hard work I’ve been waiting for this season again thank you 🙏🏻Just finish watching the show. It is amazing !!! I really enjoy it. Very fun funny and loving cant wait for the next ss!!!eagerly waiting for the new season 😍🙌😀I cried A LOT in episode 15Amenadiel : He does his best when you put a little faith in him.

It's like taehyungs coolnessTaehyung definitely owes it to his mother. He’s looking so good!I knew things would get extremely dangerous once we got vutter poodle performances, but didn't expect to be this much. It's like taehyungs coolnessBiden's mask falling down every 5 seconds lmao how does that even happenTrump: COVID actually is good for you. 
Fans: ......d'ok.Plexi glass cube just for Trump, my god that will be hilarious. It would be like bringing out an exhibit. 😂😂If he doesn't want to do it in person why not online?Biden's mask slipping is the perfect visual metaphor for politicsBetter than EastendersIf he's on a screen, at least they would be able to mute him.They should do it online, that way they can also mute one participant while the other talks and not make a huge mess out of it like the last one.I think this is gonna be a game changer for Trump. Wishing him good luck...Let's hope the man is now okWhy does the guy that does not have Covid not want to do the debate - considering it will be safe through following precautions? I think we know...Even Bidens mask was trying to quietly slink away from him tee hee hee 😂They should wheel him out like Hannibal LecterLol biden 🤣🤣🤣he cracks me upJoe Biden just doesn’t want to get a Covid-19 off Trump 😂😂😂Good bless him 💪The world is a stage and the show must go onWell let's  hope he stays wellIt's good but strange hearing Biden completed his sentencesBiden doing everything he can to try and avoid debating trumpI love the cuts every 5 seconds. Let the man talk uninterrupted.Legend 👏Just do the debate via Zoom. Problem solved. Extra points for problem-solving if you mute their mics when the other is talking so they can't interrupt each otherJust as long as they can shut his mic off any time someone else is 'trying' to talk 🙄🤦🏽‍♂️ffsif they do it online maybe they can just mute someone when they are interrupting 😂😂Yay!!! I’m glad. That’s if he’s still here.Joe Rogan gonna have some cheeky talks about thisIf Biden debates Trump from his basement I think there should be someone independent there to make sure he doesn't have a teleprompter.A strong leader 👍At first they were saying that Trump wanted to dodge the debate? Doesn't look like that to me.*LEARN IT - he knows he had Covid-19 and KNOWS he is immune and the worse he will have will be few snorts and coughs and I am same as him now.*Put a glass screen in front of joe...promise he won't be using an auto cue 🤣🤣🤣I think they should have a mass debateI guess the debate could still happen if Trump tests negative on the day in an official, independent test (how that could be guaranteed...I do not know).It’s like a Sci fi/ comedy film 🙈😂Good man. Show the people its nothing to be worried about as its not. Notice its Joe that wants to call it off!I feel very sorry for his wifeThis man has shown covid ain't all that ...If he’s still Covid positive he won’t be allowed to enter the building (unless his family breaks rules again). Virtual debate would seem to be the answer, not just switch his microphone off if he interrupts again but the camera too!Bruh, he’s gonna keel over a quarter of the way inI was more focused on his mask falling off his noseMaybe the bubble boy has a bubble for Joe to protect him from covid for the debateI can't wait for the next episode.They are just scared of how it will goIt’s like a tragicomedy based on a true story that is yet to happen.They all deserve to catch it if this happens. ... it's like watching a reality show - an embarrassingly bad one. ....Didnt hear the bit where he "refused", come on do your jobs betterI feel like the Sun is trying to put Biden in the wrongAs soon as trump said he’s going to be back out front, “ as your leader I had to do that”. I smell a stunt, convenient timing 🤣Fast covid recovery, at 74, not bad.
God bless the POTUS.He should get a decent mask that fits and doesn't keep slipping down.Last week the TDS crew were claiming Trump was trying to get out of the next debate.
So.....what's the conspiracy they have this week?THEY COULD ALWAYS DO ZOOM,UNLESS TRUMP DOES NOT WANT THAT."whoever tests positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate for at least 1 week minimum, ideally 2 weeks"
Trump leaves hospital days after testing positive for a joyride.
Biden is right to decline the next debate, as that's the best debate he can give. It's legit safe to say "stay away from Trump".He should be clear of Covid 19 first of all before any contest 
Second a zoom for him will suffice and just mute him if he interjectsBest president America has had, pure dedication that man has for his country! Wish we had the same here in ScotlandWhy Avengers music play behind him? He ain't gonna stop Thanos.I would not want to be in the same room with coronavirus Trump. He doesn’t care about anyone but himself.they can just use human avatars to represent themselves and narrate the speech through earphonesBiden should walk on stage in a moon suit...and they should make Trump ring a bell whilst shouting ‘unclean..unclean’This debate could go ViralSomeone needs to tell Biden to cross the strings on his maskIf they wanted to have this debate....nothing would stand in the way.....ways around everything.
They do what bloody suits them.
Which is stand up comedy for the world.....🤣🤣🤣🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿He should feel good, been taking Hydrochlorapotion and zinc etc etc, unlike us lot who are deliberately denied it so that we make more 'statistics' for the gov to manipulate.Appart from sleepy , Joe is now also cowardlyYa'll know he got treated by social healthcare (healthcare funded by taxpayers)?

Either he feels 20 years younger and public healthcare isn't that bad or he's lying.Trump tryna wipe out his competition 😂😂😂This man will forever refuse to be beaten, no matter what it is. Loans, Bankruptcy, Debates, Illnesses, half a country against him. 

You can call this man a lot of things, but you have to admire the guys work ethic.Better than 20 years ago because he ate healthily in hospital.. (no burgers 🍔)He sounds like he’s struggling lmaoI think Joe will going to wear astronaut space suit 👀Why not just do the debate online?They're just hopping mad because he survived.Need to admire the courage, inner belief and winning spirit of Trump, unlike sleepy  Biden who seems to be backing offBiden is trying to chicken out. I'd like to see the debate. "Come on man"Actually, Trump canceled.

I wonder if he really had Covid or if he was just unwilling to go back on the debate stage after his disastrous first performance.ladies and gentleman this is what you call a smoke screen🤷🏼‍♀️Debate from separate rooms via a tv monitors🤷🏾‍♀️It shouldn't even be a question for the debate happening if he is still testing positive but they should do it digitally if that is the case. Added bonus, it would mean the moderator can easily press mute to shut Trump up.Running from the debates!!! Uncle Don wins againLock her up !Mr president, you wouldn’t get voted for chairmen of a 5-aside football team.Joe knows trip ain’t got COVID anymore 🐣 chickening out lol 😂I was waiting for this. Its all getting a bit too predictable.Biden would be stupid to debate Trump face to face after everything we know about covid19. 
Why can't it be done via zoom ?This is elder abuse. Poor Joe.Life is a game and Donald trump plays his game very well. There are 2 people in the election and Donald is making sure that he is the one at the centre of it all which puts the other guy in the shade. It would have been far more interesting if Clint Eastwood was the other guy!Yes big Don👊🏻Have the debate on Trump’s home ground. TwitterBiden would want to cancel the debate if Trump had an ingrowing toenailAlways think to yourself, which presidential candidate would I least mind having to watch take a dump? If you want a clue, it's not the person who's surname rhymes with that last sentence.Thank you President Trump for your hard work.  Please work 4 more years for us.  You are the only president we can count on, and the enemies raised by the former government are laughing at the United States.  Please, be healthy and make a great America again👍👍👍For those that struggle with English.

I told that boy to hold his BREATH.

I then asked him to BREATHE.

Good. Now  he’s BREATHING normally.

Please stop spelling BREATHE as BREATH!

I get triggered every time lol. 😂He may as well not wear that mask 😷 his not even fitted it on right lolLet's summarize COVID-19:

2010 - The first mentions of the coronavirus pandemic appear on the Rockefeller Foundation website

2012 - US National Intelligence Council report: by 2030, expect a new type of virus to reach every corner of the world

2014 - Research into corona virus mutation begins in a laboratory in North Carolina
The team leader is professor Ralph Baric and his assistant Lisa Gralinski, of Polish origin

2015 - a moratorium on this research is announced in the US, due to the risk to the world being too great if the strains get outside

2015 - Baric publishes a scientific work on the NATURE portal, where it presents the results of its research
A French professor reviewing this paper in Paris writes: the trajectory of this virus may be unpredictable

2016 - the project is transferred to the military
a laboratory in Wuhan, China, established in the context of a possible future biological warfare
Project leader Shi Zenghli, called BAD WOMAN, recognizes the ACE2 receptor, which is the same in bats and humans, so she can transmit natural animal coronaviruses to humans. Preferred direction of infection: human lungs - a quote from the research results
The pathogen is converted into a mutant biological weapon by adding to it by the human hand a so-called "enhanced action function"

2016 - At the Detroit airport, the FBI stops a Chinese scientist carrying MERS and SARS samples

2017 - Piotr Czumakhow, Russian microbiologist says that things are "absolutely crazy" in Wuhan
Dr Fauci talks about a surprising disease during Trump's current tenure in a lecture at Georgetown University

2018 - first simulations of a future pandemic

2019 - October - the Event201 conference in New York and a precise scenario of the development of the coronavirus epidemic (talks are being held on how to manipulate the media and how to censor the "hostile" narrative ")

2020 - the project is implemented, although the virus is twice less contagious, it kills relatively rarely

03.2020 Bill Gates tries to force WHO to declare a pandemic - WHO does not want to do this

14.03 Bill Gates donates 50 million dollars to WHO

03/15 WHO declares a pandemic state (this state allows the introduction of drugs and vaccines without safety testing - what is the real purpose of vaccination?)  

The world stopped on the basis of a computer simulation suggesting that 100 million people would die.
According to computer models, the same company no longer has glaciers in Antarctica.

COVID-19 replaces all other diseases

Data manipulation is at its apogee. Data is not collated, it is only shown selectively.

The RT PCR test used shows false in even 8 out of 10 cases. The CDC says that even if the test is positive and you have symptoms, it doesn't mean you have the virus.

No laboratory in the world has a complete picture of the virus genome. Accordingly, what is being tested and what the vaccine is supposed to work against.

The facts are slowly starting to form a mosaic

Hospitals get several times more money for a patient with covid diagnosis and an additional bonus for connecting to a ventilator

Censorship is in full swing. People who speak differently from governments and the mainstream media are removed. Scientists and doctors, not to mention ordinary people, are ridiculed and muted.

There is information that "covid-19" is included in all those who died in hospitals. No matter what the patient really died of.

Only the hospital dies of covid - no data on those who died outside the hospital.

The virus is just a tool, the targets are different

Governments are walking on the belt of behind-the-scenes power operating by corrupting the worlds of science, media, politics and medicine

Following the fait accompli method - after four months of the pandemic, the virus itself has killed no more people than the seasonal flu, while the psychosis generated around the case has a real destructive power

The scenario is perfectly executed

The scale of unprecedented social surveillance is growing

COVID-19 becomes the perfect weapon.

Virtually anything can be done under his pretext

Another wave of the virus is "planned" in the fall this autumn ! ! !It's best if Biden follows the guidance of his carers.Corona slapped off his hair dye 😂When are we going to see a conservative Moderator?, so far we have had two Dem leaning Moderators. Just putting it out there.You can physically SEE him struggling, Jesus H, that man's going to get himself killed!They should use zoom so then the moderator can just mute Trump when he won't shut upWhat is Biden worried about?  He would be able to wear his mask and that would protect him.Stick him in a glass box, soundproofed so the moderator can do their job better.
Then to make things more entertaining add in a gunk tank overhead and have the whole thing sit on a gimballed platform that can be moved about like a swingometer controlled by a website poll. He goes to far and the voters swing will apply a new shade of "tan"Lovely video MASHALLAH THANK YOUSleepy joe is full of bs, doesn't want to be made a fool of on TV again 😂🤦‍♂️Biden using trumps diagnosed covid case as a escape goat of getting out of the debate 😂😂😂. The man can’t even talk without getting his words mixed upGet them on a zoom with Rogan as moderator. This is 2020 we need more transparency. The fact that Biden is not open to a debate with Rogan in itself should be a reason not to vote for him. What does he have to hide?.Imagine living in a country where you can't believe a word the president of that country says.Maybe they should use trumps spitting image puppet on the live debate?! Surely it could do a better job and it’s the best dead ringer I’ve ever seen. 😂I think (hope) they quietly replaced him with a double while in hospital :DOn the premise of keeping us safe... Technology gathers apace... Technocracy. 1984.Poor Biden he doesn't realise that the tellybox doesn't need them to be in the same placeIt's funny how hes worried about catching covid but misusing the mask by touching the front of it several times lolhe literally didn't refuse come on and stop with the dramatic titles now, it's 2020Make sure that Plexiglas box is hermetically sealed; don't want to be taking any chance after all.
😉👍Is that 14 days isolation?How come trumps voice sounds different? It sounds deeper and less nasally.Munk debate was good format. And why is he touching his mask?God bless you all today.0:22 - ohhhh don't let those lies escape.He doesn’t have covid he’s just had a positive result from a faulty test.Aka I don't want to have the debate because I will get destroyed again. Don't blame him to be fair.Biden is scaredThe most sensible, understandable and obvious move was for Biden to refuse outright, cant blame himGood for Biden.  Im with him on thisAny excuse to get out of a debate.This man is a god  MAGAthey should do the debate online, so when one speaks they can mute the other. you act like children, you get treated like children.Donald: mask are useless 

Me: next thing you know he catches Coronavirus🦠😷Biden cancels more than more than my credit card he is skipping in that helicopter to get away from another debateis the presence of Biden actually required, I mean the last debate was Trump v Wallace while  Biden might off as well been asleep in his armchair.

So if Biden is scared of Trump he should stay at home, get a pipe , some hot coco and play Gin rummy with the local vicar.Bet Biden will have a mask on lolZoom/Skype/any online conferencing service easy enough to work around so tump has a virtual presence at the debate.also Works for Chris Wallace because he can mute trump when he needs to so everyone is a winnerMore than covid immunityDoesn't anyone else think this all seems slightly... orchestrated? Feels like a TV dramaWhat a guy, the hardest working president in historyAt least with zoom Trump the clown could be silenced to let Biden get a word in.Good performancerespect to Biden for calling him PresidentEven devil don't want this guyDo the American people want someone like Joe who is this fragile running the country just imagine if the doctors and nurses treating this virus were this fragile or are military personnel police fireman or the cashier at any fast-food or store or the utility workers and so on well let me tell you it wouldn't be tolerated for one minute and you'd be unemployed whatever happens Joe absolutely can not be in harms way being the President but it's perfectly fine for all these other people to be in harms way 40+ hours a weekBiden doesn’t want any of the smoke after that first round KOThis is like a WWE promo segmentI don't blame him. I would want a certificate from his drs to say he's clear before setting foot on that stage.Any excuse to get out of a debateBiden has lost before he started, 😂😂😂😂😂😂🇬🇧🇺🇸Just the act of tweeting "I feel great" is enough to drive the media and left into a meltdown  Trump is comedy gold and god level troll.Biden wants a note from his handlers to avoid the debate 😂Biden should get a mask that fitsGod Bless President Trump and his Administration 🙏
Up to minute 0:57
"I'm not sure what President Trump is all about now".
Well.. 🙄 (observing)
A few poems this morning..
Biden appears to be hidin'
Under a mask.
..and now, with plexiglass!
My husband said to me, out of the blue, the other day:
"If the same gender you be ridin'..  You wanna vote for Joe Biden"
I stopped everything I was doing and laughed for a good 30 minutes! 😂🤣😂
That's how we roll.
Inside Michigan, USA 🇺🇸
Good luck with us.GO BIDEN!!!!!This is such a stunt it’s so cringey it’s ridiculously obvious and it’s so funny how the public literally can’t see itBiden would refuse if trump had a sore anklevery greatHe never had Covid-19 what a ploy to show how great he isjust have a digital debate !just do a virtual meetingTrump supporters: Covid  will make it harder for him to debateZoom call debate😂Trump is a boss 👏🏼why cant he get tested?Covid slayer 2020Doesn't matter if you like or dislike Donald Trump, you cannot deny the energy and passion he has.He isn't feeling better, he is out of breath.Never thought I’d support even verbally another neoliberal, but go on Biden.who would you vote for?Well timed publicity stunt maybe 🤔Do it virtually.... That way everytime Trump interrupts he can just be "muted" 🤷🏻‍♂️Trump's spirit is for the future of America,  Trump 2020 !!!!👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Ignore the man behind the curtain.....carry on watching the show.....popcorn anyone ?I think we should all respect Donald trump and what he stands for and also we should respect the American people for being a grate nation .Just perspex box it, Biden!!God bless 🙏 US president good job 👍 Pa-Shout outThey could easily use a plexiglass type wall.. not only could the debates go on, it would help show the wall works! Keeping those that want to cause harm to the US out (Sleepy Joe)I'm not suprised - a mild cold would finish Biden off!Biden, you are never sure!Trump is the better candidate, but whether is makes a difference to people's lives is up for debate.Joe running scaredIf he even had the virus to begin with...Trump should debate himself, after all he is a schizophrenic. He'd still lose though!I don't blame Biden, he showed his 77 years in the last one. Should be in a retirement home!!Yup coz obviously there's not this amazing technology called "glass" which can be used to separate rooms and allow each debater to see the other one (and check for teleprompters)If he still has COVID, which he should if his timeline is to be believed, then he should be quarantining. He shouldn’t risk transmitting it to others just to play a game of chicken and protect his fragile ego.

Still ridiculous dramatic music.truly truly unwell" Come on Man " How can Biden deny us the pleasure of watching him being torn to shreds by Trump again.   Still need him to explain his views on the " Peaceful Protesters & the Peaceful 138 murders/deaths and the Peaceful £2Billion damage caused by Peaceful Protesters " who support him....Biden's mask falling down every 5 seconds lmao how does that even happenI mean, Biden is correct here. I don't understand how people could really argue with it.Need to admire the courage, inner belief and winning spirit of Trump, unlike sleepy Biden who seems to be backing offI shall answer the question of "is that a shark?" Yes, it's a nurse shark who mainly hunt at night but can be active in the dayThat there is a nurse shark, it’s just resting and is completely fine.Nurse sharks lie on the ground a lot, they hunt at night most of the time and do sometimes swim around during the day but mostly just kinda lay thereHey I’ve actually been studying sharks my whole life, and I can safely tell you that nurse Shark is NOT dead rather she is just waiting for a meal. Thank you for time, and no I am not a marine biologist I’m just a guy who loves sharksSays leroy
My brain :Hiii hi boys, now stay with me cause I'm quite quick, and liam you stay right there cause you are perrfect.

Also poor sharkWhen I was 5 a nurse shark swam up to me and it couldn’t of cared less about me they are not dangerousThis is probably the calmest I ever saw Datrie"omg i think hes dead" ah yes... the only fish that lays the right way around on the bottom of the water:the nurse sharkI'm an Aussie and that's what we call a port Jackson nurse shark there smaller then regular nurse sharks they lay on shallow sea beds most of the time and lay in wait for preyYeah that's a shark.. you can actually swim with that shark because it doesn't have teeth and means no harm to humansThat is a nurse shark. They rarely attack people and usually feed on small fish and have hundreds of rows of teeth but that shark is not dead and is doing perfectly fine.So that's a nurse shark! They are one of few types of sharks (if I remember correctly that is, it's been many years since I've studied them lol) that's actually able to pump water through their gills so they can breathe and don't have to constantly swim to breathe! Pretty cool right?!?!No he just sucks vitamins out if a special type of rock



He no dedI love how much you care about animals ❤️I have nurse sharks in my school pond under like this bridge or smt. I rarely see them move-leroy must be protected at all costsThe previous short was Usman viciously knocking Masvidal out and this one starts off with a girl  saying "look at the fish" lmaoNurse sharks are so adorableNobody: me being sad because she didn’t finish saying the fish fact about Leroy 🥲Yeah it’s a shark specifically a nurse shark. I’ve swam with them before and they are genuinely really nice animals to be around even tho I almost pissed my self out of fearI love that nurse sharks are completely harmless I was at the beach with my family we were getting out of ze water and a giant nurse shark just swooped by my mom she tried to move of ze way and it did to xD we love nurse sharksThe sad thing is she never finished the fact about LeroyYeah florida man here, sharks are more active at night, high tide or during the early fish migration periods.

Sharks often just chill on the bottom of the ocean but the shark needs to occasionally move to get water past the gills to breatheA few sharks do sleep like that do not worry he's not dead or she does sleeping trust me in the aquariums the big ones are sleeping and trust me you look amazing up close when they're far away it's really hard to see the detail when I'm sleeping we can see it much better they usually like to sleep and dark areas where it's really closed inThat’s actually a Plako! Aka a algae eater! They clean all the algae off of surfaces in water, I have like 5 in my fish tank!It is a shark,a nurse shark to be specific so it’s most likely trying to rest currently given it’s primarily NocturnalThere goes my last brain cell 🙃I'm so happy she posted she makes everything better 🥰🥰Beautiful water. Where is this?Just a nearly harmless nurse shark that likes to nap at the bottom of the seaHer : Leroy
Me : *inner marcel comes alive *
 I want you to meet Leeroy. He's going to be your choreographer. Leeroy! Hmmmm-mmmmThat's a nurse shark lots of people mistake them for a pleckastotamus which is usually put in fishtanks for maintenanceNurse shark. Unlike some sharks they can control their breathing and don't need to constantly swim. 
Florida gurl.
😀👍it’s a nurse shark they just chill at the bottom he’s alive and they aren’t mean!He's here to tell you about your cars extended warrantyI want you to meet Leroy he’s going to be our choreographer, Leroy hHmMNice I'm first. Leroy's cute.aquatic awesome! I love fish so so muchHer: is that a shark? Is it dead

Shark: no I’m sleeping now goYasssss we gotta Stan Leroy!!! 
Wait was the shark dead?? 
So confusing haha!! 
Love you Datrie!!!💖You need some David attenborough in your life.That was a baby tiger shark. Your lucky to see one of those"Is that a shark" my brain cells have gone below freezing temperaturesIt's actually one of those fish that cleans the algae off of any surface and an ocean or a fish tank a lot of people have them in their home so yeahThere are actually a lot of sharks that can stay still and not be dead though most joggers ones need to be moving some smaller ones such as nurse sharks can be completely still for a long period of time so that shark is probably fineit's a shark uwu (I think, I lost my last two brain cells on a kahoot-)Nurse sharks there usually docile u can even swim with them :)That looks like a nursery zone for the angle sharkdatrie: oh my gaw- what is dat?I dont remember then name of that fish in English but in Malay it is calles Ikan Bandaraya. It usually stay in only one place and make the germs as it foodIf you ask Missy and Christina, they'll tell you he just pulled up to the carwash 🤣😂All directioners coming across this video: PER - FECT*She never finished her sentence but instead talks about the sleepy nurse shark*Its a janitor it clean the oceans and lakes, you can keep it as a pet to 😊Only Directioners know who the real Leeroy is......That's a big Suckermouth catfish and it doesn't harm humans it has pointy texture the entire body though.It could be an algae eater they get very big depending on their living environmentShe names the shark leeroy 
All the directioners on YouTube: report to duty its time to fangirlIt's hibernating.... "BABY SHARK DODODODODODOODODOD"Nurse sharks are mostly harmless. Same with port Jackson sharks. They mainly eat mollusks so the fish will be safe for the most part.Her : Leroy
Me : *inner marcel comes alive *
 I want you to meet Leeroy. He's going to be your choreographer. Leeroy! Hmmmm-mmmmIt's breakfast , lunch , and dinner judging by the size of it.Nurse sharks like to lay on the bottom while waiting for prey. Hes not dead. 😂“Leroy”

*My inner Leeroy coming alive*
Hi boys, hi! Okay here’s what I’m thinking. The first opening number is gonna be big. Stay with me cuz I’m quite quick and 5 6 7 8 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and Niall, for the shimmy for the shimmy for the shimmy, and zayn pirouettes and Louis do the splits and Liam stay right where you are because you are per-fect!Leroy better look out.

*thats a Nurse Shark, they eat smol fish*That's a catfish most like the dard but sometime some like the light.Me scrolling through YT stories:👁👄👁
Me seeing Datrie but not recognizing her: "She looks familiar...."
Me looking at who made the story: "DATRIE?! GIRL I LITERALLY LOVED YOUR VIDS?! WHY YOU AINT TALKING FAST?!"


Btw still love ya❤😊why he just laying there?”

me: sleeping or- you guessed it, *dead*I had one of those a year or so back, the name we gave it was a pun of the Norwegian name of that animal aswell as the word "mustache" put tougetter Idk why it just fitIt's a sand shark the reason why it's on the ground cuz it's trying to blend in with the sand so it doesn't get EatonThats a Filipino cat fish:)Thats a janitor fish

(Thats what they call it in the philippines)“and this is Leroy he’s going to be your choreographer, Leroy hmmm” “hi boys, stay with me because I’m quite quick and 5 6 7 8 and Niall do the shimmy did the shimmy do the shimmy and Zayn pirouette and Louis do the splits and Liam you say exactly the way you are because you are per-fect” if you know you know 💙💚🇬🇧🇮🇪❤️Everyone immediately thinks of a shark, while forgetting the very obvious answer... catfish. Catish is the bottomfeeder fish.It's probably a sand shark that's why it's laying there so it's not dead or it's a catfish.🤔👍I think everyone’s directioners side came out when she said Leroy!I hope he isn't dead 🥺😭People sayin it's a nurse shark, that actually looks like a plecostamosus, I have one and they get the length of your forearm or bigger (the common pleco is known as a sucker fish for non-aquarium lover people) and they often get released to the wild by people who buy a pleco as a tank cleaner from petsmart or whatever and nobody tells them those mfs get literally the size of a nurse shark or sometimes bigger. Easy to mistake but the dorsal fin being less fleshy and more fin-like is a good tell. Also the fact it looks like a dang wacky catfish and stays on the bottom of most bodies of water. They look like catfish sharks they're really amazing, but they need tons and tons of space. (I don't know if that's fresh or saltwater though if it's saltwater I'm wrong it's only a small clip so idk don't kill me in the replies)Why is YouTube becoming tick tok"Omg..... WHAT IS THAT??"
Its a fish lmaoThat’s a nurse shark they stay at the bottom and feed on smaller animals and I think plants that are down there there nice sharksWhen I heard leeroy my mind went- now I’m quite quick and five six seven eight and one two three four five six seven eight and Niall do the shimmy do the shimmy do the shimmy and zayn pirouette and Louis do the splits and Liam you stay exactly where you are because you are pet-fect.Ever seen the sucker fishes at a pet store?
Thats what they look like with room to growWelcome to the ocean sweetheart. where there are fish, and yes, sharksthank you i was having the worst weekCat fish be chilling.     Edit:ocording to others it is a nurse shark highly IntriguingIt's not dead it's just a nurse shark laying down.I love you datire good thing it wasn’t dead🥺❤️We all just got catfished..Nurse Shark,they are sharks that protect their young. But they would never hurt a humanthat’s a plecostomus (often called pleco) they look like that because they eat algae   They are kind of like the vaccumes of the fish world! They can get very big.If a fish or shark in this case dies he would be floatingtiktok girls be like: If its not dead it must be a sharkHe is actually asleep. Yes! Sharks do sleep during the day!! 😁😁Lol...that's not Leroy😂😂😂Omg it’s so cute!! Ily!if that’s freshwater i’m pretty sure that’s a type of catfish called a, “plecostomus” or pleco for short. it’s that “suction cup fish” you see common at petco. the common pleco can get to 2ft+

if it’s salt water than it’s some sort of floor surfing shark that isn’t harmful to people :)I think that is a sucker fish they can grow extremely bigGood choice for the name :)FINALLY EARLY YAYYYYYYY







Poor shark Boi may you rest in peace ✌





I'm naming the shark: Martha if a girl and Flippers of a boy 😌.







We should make a funeral for Martha/FlippersAlways get teary eyes knowing how she was just getting started and had so much left to bless the world with. One of a kind. Her, Madonna & Beyonce would be neck & neck.The saddest thing is that we all know how it ends.I really wanted them to bring back Constance Marie as Selena’s mom. Her performance in the movie was amazingSo far the story has been told really well, despite some cringey parts in the series. The actress playing Selena gets better as the series progresses. I'll give her credit she actually sounds like Selena when she's talking. But considering a 2nd season is coming, I hope she dives alot deeper and embodies more of Selena's characteristics in the coming season.This makes me want to cry. 20+ years later Selena’s death still upsets me. She was such a big star and yet still just at the beginning of her career. She had so much more left to show the world. RipI have mixed feelings about this series. On the positive side, I think the show did well in showcasing more of not just Selena but also her whole family's life. It gives insight to the moments we never knew about before. I also never knew that Selena had so many different hairstyles and experimented so much on her look. I also think it's cool they are using Selena's actual voice, it's great they are staying true to that. However, I feel like the casting, specifically for Selena, is off. I get that not even JLo herself looked much like selena but at least she was able to dance like her and bring out her charisma. They could've hired someone who looked more like the actual Selena and also had her curves. This girl is decent at acting, but it could've been better as far as the physical aspect.Even after so many years, she's popular still. Imagine what she would be if she were still alive 😍Can we all just appreciate the fact that Selena is still relevant almost 26 years after her death? People who never even heard of Selena will see this and hear her music. And her hairstyles in this trailer are ON POINT. She's not Selena's clone, but I think she looks like her.I am so glad another generation gets to see just how wonderful and beautiful and kind that Selena is. A new generation knowing her name and songs...keeping her memory alive is...no words.You can never get enough of Selenas!!! Way ahead of her time... A TRUE ICON!Netflix is literally covering every popular Musical artist, even the old ones. 
First, Taylor Swift's Miss Americana, Motley Crue's The Dirt, Blackpink's Light up the Sky, Shawn Mendes' In wonder, and now, Selena is hitting the network. Love their musical efforts.SO FAR, I AM LOVING THIS SERIES!❤

I"ve already heard WAY MORE of her songs in this first season than was included in the Selena movie.
I love to see their struggle, their stress, their happiness, and their strong work ethic.

The character Abraham looks a lot more authentic on this show.  He's bossy, controlling and really overbearing at times....I TOTALLY believe that's how he is in real life!😂

And poor A.B....he's so stressed out.  There's so much pressure placed on him to keep coming up with new songs all the time....he looks like he's about to burn out!

Christian is even beginning to look more and more like Selena during the performances.   
I love it.  I love all of it!  ❤It’s crazy how she had fans from every race. I’m a black girl from Louisiana and she was always played at our family reunions and get togethers. Music is the language of the world and Selena was definitely one of music’s angels. I can’t imagine what it was like seeing her perform live. ♥️Y'all i got chills when I heard "Baila esta Cumbia" I know people be mad at her father and about a new series not starting JLo. But man am I happy for new generations knowing her story and keeping this Reina's memory alive. Us true Selena fans will consume most of her stuff. Te extrañamos mi reina del TexMex. 🌹I FELT GOOSEBUMPS HEARING SELENA'S ACTUAL SINGING VOICE THAT'S!  ALL ...This series really isn''t easy to get through.  Definitely hits hard, taking you back to that time even with your own family.I’m glad they using Selena’s actual voice for the song preformances!I don't know if the series will have the same impact as the movie, but the movie makes me cry every single time.Even after so much time her music still gets me on my feet and moving ! I get chills !No one will be Selena ever just like no one will be Whitney Houston...There are singers but then there are legends..She is a legend!!!😁😁❤❤The  casting in the original Selena movie was just too good that this seems like a ripoff 😭Well, can't wait for SelenaI feel like this series is gonna make me appreciate JLO's Selena more than I did💀GIVES ME CHILLS!! I remember listening to Selena since I was 5 years old, now 28.I just watched all 9 episodes and I can't get enough. Congratulations to all actors. *Selena will always stay in our hearts...*Fiquei emocionado só com o Trailer. Selena Vive!!! ❤Fun fact: The actress who plays Marcela, Selena’s mom is the same actress that played Selena’s cousin in the 1997 film. The one she goes to the mall with and scolds the lady with the $800 dress. 👗That voice, wow, still gets me every single time. I grew up on 90s R&B, but I always thought Selena's voice was so soulful. Can't wait for Dec. 4.The thing I like about this version is that they seem to be highlighting Selena’s career in the 80s while the 1997 film focused mainly on her career in the early 90s.This show brings back so many memories of growing up in a musical family. On stage with my dad and feeling that connection. Whatever the drama in real life I'm happy this show made me remember that.I don't know if it's the real / true story of Selena, but I definitely loved the series, and looking forward to see more seasons.. ❤️I remember hearing Selena's story for the first time in 1997 when I was thirteen years old. I was so moved by it that when I reached high school, I convinced my Spanish teacher to include it in her curriculum as part of her classes that week including ours.  I am not a Latina, but her story has continued to inspire me in the years since then and she has been an important role model in my life. She was once quoted as saying "The goal is not to live forever, but to create something that will". While it would be far better to have her with us today, her legacy has definitely lived on and will continue to touch others' lives for good. Selena Vive! =)I can never watch anything with Selena without chocking up. It’s just so hard not too. I meant the trailer got me all chocked up. Credit to the actress and actresses who have portrayed her for keeping her alive and keep us having hope that anything is possible even with all the adversity and through these hard times I know it’s not an easy task stepping in her heels hehe. But thank youI LOVED this series and can’t wait season 2. First couple of episodes are a bit cringe HOWEVER you can see the effort and better it gets. I started crying at the end of the seasonOk I’ve watched all of part one because Selena is truly a huge inspiration in my life. I have to say that the actress does look like J lo, but I really like how they are focusing on the family dynamic. I think it’s great to see a new side of Selena . I admire them for making it a series young girls can watch to look up to Selena.GREAT Netflix Series. It brings Selena to life for people who knew who not and celebrates the many facets of her wonderful character and personality.  Probably the best series I have ever seen by Netflix.Almost 2021 and she still rocking, imagine if she didn't pass. She is a legend.As a Texan, this makes me so emotional. 😭❤I love that they made the movie and show such a tribute to Selena's memory. For both they cast someone who disappeared into her character.
Those complaining about JLo's portrayal of her in the movie, Selena's family said that she reminded them so much of Selena it was like she was back from the living in the small gestures she made so how about y'all respect the family's choice of actress.I love you Selena!!❤️🥺 RIP beautiful angel, forever the Queen of Tejano 👑❤️I feel like this series wasn’t about how the actors looked but really just about the story line behind Selena and the bandGoosebumps and tears every time I hear that live version of Como la Flor! 😭😭I grew up in San Antonio and Selena's music was EVERYWHERE. Every time I hear it I'm transported back to my youth and a flood of memories comes rushing in.getting chills and all the feels such a beautiful portrayal 💜🌹The way she died still brings me to tears as if she was my own child.  I'm watching the Netflix series.  KEEP HER ALIVE!  Her music was beautiful!  Her father's management was EPIC!  I heard of her death and had no clue who she was.  I heard of it while shopping for fabrics in the garment district because I'm a designer/seamstress.  OMG!  Broke my heart!  You really can't let strangers get too close to you and you really need to follow your gut or someone else's.  She should still be alive.  I LOVE HER ENGLISH SONG AND IF I KNEW SPANISH, I'D LOVE THAT TOO.I still think Jennifer nailed it in the first movie.Such a beautiful person with amazing talent.  I cried when the series was over. RIP ☹ I was 17 when I first cried for Selena.The fact that I couldn’t tell in some scenes who was meant to be Selena, says a lot on the casting choice.This is why Netflix will never lose their audience. They appeal to the bold, the dreamers, and the legends.I don't know how to feel about another Selena TV or movie thing. The movie was perfect and everything we wanted and needed, they already made a "El secreto de Selena". I'm so happy they haven't forgotten her and all that but on the same time I don't want a legend to be obscured by facts that may not be real if you understand what I mean I just love and adore her and the movie just how they were and still areI just binged Part 1 and it’s great! The story goes more in depth than the movie with JLo.  Her music lives on through biopics. The entire worked extremely hard to make her dreams come true. Her Father reminds me of Papa Joe Jackson, without the physical abuse. Not letting anything get in the way of their goals.  Now, I understand a lot more. AB had a lot on his shoulders. It was her Father who put her killer in her path, which I’m certain he regrets every second, but he didn’t know. Let’s enjoy this and anticipate Part II. All the actors/actresses did a wonderful job! I loved how they played  all the funky R&B throughout the series. Shows they loved different music genres.Even though I'm sure the series will not be perfect/have some flaws, I'll take any Selena content. She means so much to the Mexican American/Tejano community, I'm glad her legacy is being kept alive. RIP Reina 💜💜💜I’m glad the Selena story will get more in depth with a series as opposed to just a 90 min film (which was AMAZING) but definitely better format in a series, well done NetflixWill never beat the movie. The movie is far superior in acting, looks, character chemistry and overall everything. 💯😭I’d always get so sad thinking how she was taken too soon. Then that quote about “ don’t be sad she died but be happy they were ever born” hit me. Can you imagine a world with zero Selena songs? What a sad sad place 💯

Thankful for what she was able to give us in her limited time here.I love the movie, and thought i wouldn't like the series but surprisingly I love it too. It's more detailed and not rushed. We get to see a little bit of the other family members. The actress did a good job.Okay I was skeptical on the cast selection but looking at this trailer. Her beautiful soul just melts my heart .I will support anything SELENA we love you ❤❤❤💅 QUEEN 💯While it's great to see Selena's legacy still growing. Its sad and wrong that Selena's husband, Chris Perez was not in any way told or involved about the Netflix project.For all those who complain that the actress does not look like Selena I tell you,  that Selena was not "a physical", Selena was more than that ..... she was SOUL.        
It matters more to me that the series shows how Selena was..... as an artist.....as a human, and not simply physically similar.Las espero con ansias. <3I absolutely love Selena a lot she has a real true die hard fan in me I have a lot of Selena shirts I love a lot of her songs Selena lives forever if you have a dream don’t let anybody take it away and always believe the impossible is always possible she is my queen the queen lives foreverShout Out to all my Tejanos out there. We're #1 always and Forever. R.I.P. Selena Quintanilla La Reina Del Tejano.I just finished it, OMG I LOVE IT!!  I laughed I cried it’s so beautiful 😍I always believed that she was a woman who was ahead of her time, from interviews & her music.. still to today her legacy is alive throughout many fans!Selena was such an awesome person, can’t wait for this ❤️I can’t wait. It looks like it will be pretty good. We just need more Selena in our lives.I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING!! IM SO EXITED I LOVE YOU SELENA❤️❤️❤️WE NEED SEASON TWO!I wish they would just put the Selena Movie on NetflixFinally! I so can't wait to watch more life of Selena 💔 Since I arrive in Texas this year, I saw the statue of herself and that day on I listen to her music.She may not look like Selena but I’m gonna watch anyways, the fact that she’s just as celebrated 25 years later just...🥰🥰💜💜💜Just started watching..... So amazing to see how they were able to expand more of the details of Selena's life & career not even mentioned in the 1997 film we all know.Ansiosa x que comienze se merecía una serie la reina de mi vidaI love it 🥰 im waiting for the second part already :) me encanto 💕 y no se diga el suspenso en que quedo la primer parte 😳i love how they include the actual singing voice of Selena for the real songs played in the seriesAlways makes me cry when I see Selena and knowing how she died when she still too many things to do. She loves the stage and it was taken away from her.Forever in our hearts ❤WE LOVE YOU SELENA ♡I had the biggest crush on Selena! I just knew I would meet her someday and we would get married! Broke my heart when she passed.I do see potential for this series. I didn't like in the movie where she was one minute performing at a carnival then the next, she was a star. It would have been interesting to see the rise.I get the chills just by looking at this ! Can’t wait to see it !!!!!So happy they’re keeping her original voice for the songs. Uuugghhhhhh. My heart. So excited for this series!I loved her song Dreaming Of You. Back then I was a little kid and I recall a news that she died. It was 25 years later that I got to know the real reason of her death. I always thought it was plane crash (my memory must have been really bad). Still her memory and good music lives on. Thanks to this show and its creators.I cannot wait to see it. I love Selena when I was a little girl. I cried my eyes out when that woman died on March 31, 1995, I was 10 years old at the time. I still can’t believe it’s been 25 years of Selena’s death.I don't understand, why no one is talking about this show?! I just finished the first season, and I loved it.. ❤️The fact that Selena is so loved and people take so quickly to her and her story makes my heart warm 💓She was a beautiful young lady, so tragic what happened to her. God bless her family!! 🙏🎶So excited about the series! My daughter's middle name is Selena 🥰 . Still to this day I listen to her songs .this is a great series and christian is such a great actress :)Now yes this actress is so natural,  beautiful, young , spirited , humble , this actress gives life to Selena attitude and character  I remember Selena was still young when she died and this actress gives  life to the young spirit Selena Had . Now yes for sure will watch this Selena serie and most for the youth  spirit that this actress gives 😍😍Just finished it. Really enjoyed it. If you are a Selena fan you will love it!I recognize so many of the performances being recreated! I spotted Enamorada De Ti at the TMA’s, Buenos Amigos music video, 1989 TMA’s performances, Johnny Canales Show, Astrodome 1994, Que Creías at the TMAs, and so many more! Huge fans like me that have seen almost every performance of hers notice these details and the fact we’re getting way more than the movie showed us is so exciting!!I’ve been having a Selena marathon and now this !! Yesss 😍Que raro  se siente ver la vida de una persona que viste en su momento viva...  no es lo mismo ver la vida de alguien en una pelicula, que vivio en otro siglo o en otros años diferentes.....  espero que selena a pesar de su corta edad,. haya sido feliz con lo que tenia: su esposo, su familia, sus fans, su negocio de  ropa...I really hope this is just as good or better than the movie. Cause I love Selena and I wouldn't want a show to make others see her a different way idk if that makes sense 😂I was born the day Selena died and always felt a very special connection to her. Can’t wait to watch this series! Long live Selena!!!🌠❤️🙏🏻Why not get an entire new generation to love Selena the same way we all did almost 30 years ago and still do. No issues with my girl Selena being remembered and loved by a new younger audience as well. I do wish they cast her a bit better. Selena was curvier, gorgeous, hopefully it is still good. I am glad it's Selena's voice though.Selena’s the only artist that I can play in the car and my mom will jam to it.I see all the comments but that's because no one can and will ever look like Selena. she was one of a kind ripNetflix: “We can’t find someone who looks like Selena.” Wait! What about someone who looks like Jennifer Lopez who looks like Selena?”I’m gonna be mad af if they don’t involve chris in this more! He just posted a few weeks ago that they said that they’re gonna make him nonexistent to Selena’s legacy. But really he made her story beautiful.I feel like a lot of people hating on the show (saying looks low budget, cast, and movie is better) which I just don’t understand. It’ll give us another beautiful piece into Selena’s life! Also her family have been a part of the project and I feel that they wouldn’t support or put anything out that didn’t do her justice. 
Not trying to put hate out or anything all love ❤️ and excited for the show!!I watched the series. I thought it was great. Selena’s story wasn’t the only story to tell. Her family was her number one and by sharing their    experiences also shared her story. She wasn’t the main focus of story in the series but rather her whole family on a journey with their band.i can't wait till it comes out, when i watched the movie it  made me cry and it was so heart touching and it really inspired me to be a singer when i grow up!I am very surprised by the over all feedback everywhere for this show. About a handful of points do I ever really agree with - 1. Wigs! 2. Needs more Selena. 3. Should have been called Selena y Los Dinos or the Quintanilla Family.

 I've been sitting and wondering what show some people have been claiming to watch because I found Christian incredibly charming in this role (with what they gave her thus far). And I enjoyed the expanded story that featured more of the behind the scenes of Selena's story. As in AB's struggles, and Suzettes story of trying not to be completely overshadowed by the over all ideal of SELENA. And Chris - yes, even Chris I found a little more interesting this time around. I believed those crazy kids were feeling awkward about their feelings and having to have to hide their relationship at such an odd and young pivotal point of their lives. Selena the film will always be seen in higher regards of course, but the series has me feeling some other sort of way by exploring the characters youths more. Sometimes, watching the film, I forget how young Selena truly was - and how young and naïve things had actually been for the family as a whole starting this crazy, though beautiful, Mexican-American dream.

The show isn't perfect. Budget seemed to have been thin at times. But I genuinely felt that heart had been considered and used for the making of the series. And I don't know if the hate is purely genuine, and I'm missing something others seem to see - or if perhaps people are too harsh these days and are only holding the 1997 film as Gospel.Even though nobody ever looks like the Real life Bio Character as long as they stay true to her Heart, Soul and Character and music then I'm gonna love it.....Amo amo amo amoooo a selena!! Que bueno, es lo mejor que he visto en netflix y eso que amo netflix !!Damn she went from Twilight to playing the role of Selena, that's awesome you go girl!! ♥️💘🤩The family is doing a great job keeping her legacy alive!The only thing is that they didn’t do justice to Selena’s impressive out of this world stage presence when singing and performing they did do a good job portraying her personality and her relationship with her husband who gave her such happiness before she diedOk I love that they use Selena’s real voice! Can’t wait for this!!The moment you realize that you’re older than Selena will ever be. 🥺🥺I discovered selena 3 years ago but i feel like ive loved her forever i cnt wait for this showI don’t have Netflix anymore but i will definitely sing back up. I am seeing so many ads about this series. Now i am curious to watch this. Selena represent my Mexican American culture. I love herHail The True QUEEN!!!! Selena 👑🎤❤️❤️❤️From the hallways of Ned’s Declassified (yes I went back to the beginning of her acting career), to the vast emptiness roads of walkers and other dangers of The Walking Dead, To the stages of Selena. Christian Serratos has done good throughout the years so farI agree with most comments about the casting. I was really surprised they chose this young lady. She's beautiful, but no resemblance to Selena.I'm from India and don't even understand a single word in Spanish but the magnitude of the stardom made me a fan of her.I’m rewatching on Christmas Day. It’s so good! Good job Selena Series Crew!!!I love Selena!!!! I can't wait to watch the serie!!!I’m so sad this series got a lot of bad reviews just because some people were expecting too much and being negative about it. Thinking the family is just milking money from Selena and comparing it to the movie. I think the main purpose of this series was to keep her relevant and get to know more about Selena and her family’s journey. Despite Christian does not resemble Selena, I understand why they cast her because she just has the same likeable vibe that Selena carries. I've been watching her since her Nickelodeon days ( Ned’s declassified school survival guide) until her series in Walking Dead. 

It upsets me that people remember her because she got shot (by that bruja Yolanda) and Jlo played her part. I read some comments that this series should have been in American Crime Story.Omg being a huge fan, I recognize so many performances and stories Selena or her family has told in private I’m happy that it has come to light can’t wait to see it!!!!I cried while watching this. So much has happened a wax statue, star on the walk of fame, makeup line, forever 21 clothes,a movie, now a show on Netflix and a funko pop i'm so happy for her i just wish she was here to see it 😭😭The chills, the vibes, the energy! Omg this feels like another doggface vibe haha 🥰Just finished part 1 I love the fact that Susie and AB stories are told in more depth.Its gonna be a hit, period. The production looks amazing and the musical production too.I LOVE Selena til this day and would love to watch every single second of a well produced series of her life. Unfortunately, they haven't made it yet. PS: How disrespectful to Selena to cast this girl. Not everything is cameras, make up, and lights, Hollywood. I'll be watching the next Selena in 10 or 20 years when they make another one. Hopefully, they'll get it right next time.Wow!! Yes! I had her album in my teens. I played it so much that it scratched because I played "Dreaming of You", "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" on repeat. 😭Oh my gosh, I cannot wait to watch this!! 😭♥️If it wasn't for the money hungry male family members in the Quintanilla family, I would be SOOOOOO excited over this. My adoration and admiration of Selena has remained the same since I was a kid in the early 90s. I don't think I've ever idolized an artist since her death but the men in her family have just sucked away the joy I get when I see her getting popular. Because if she gets popular, that means more of her music is going to sell, and that only means that Abraham and AB will only get richer. I refuse to buy any of her music and/or stream it--I still have her old CDs and that's how I listen to her. All of that money go to those gross individuals and it sickens me. I want to watch this mini series but since both of those men are going to majorly profit out of it, I likely won't tune in.Once a legend always a legend!No I feel like we are going in on descriptive stuff that went on and I appreciate  to know more about her as a person an her families feeling about all things on the series. I love it  so much !!!!! To me I really appreciate knowing every part of went on the movie showed me certain things but not all what went on as a family  growing up.  I love what suzette and everyone at Netflix has done to keep La Reyna Alive in our Hearts!😍Jesus, I'm ready for this , but at the same time I'm not. I'm so happy that she is still being relevant till this day, can't wait for the newer generation to get to know Selena and fall in love with her the way I did !Makes me wanna cry through out the series 🥺ONE THING THAT AMAZES ME AND PROVES ME EVERYDAY THAT SELENA WAS SO DIFFERENT THAN EVERY SINGER  I SAY THAT BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY MARRIED. HER GUITARIST . SHE DID WHAT HER HEART TOLD HER, SHE SAW A MAN NOT BASED ON HIS MONEY BUT SHE SAW A MAN SHE LOVED AND A MAN THAT WAS THERE WITH THE BAND PRACTICING AND LOOKING AT HER AS AN IDOL BECAUSE ONE THING I KNOW IS THAT CHRISTIAN WILL LOVE THIS WOMAN FOREVER. SELENA WAS NOT WRONG ASIDE FROM HIS MISTAKES AFTER HER DEPARTURE. HE STILL LOVES HER AND HE STILL HEALING.  NOW DAYS A SINGER HAS TO EITHER MARRY ANOTHER SINGER OR. A MAN. OF MONEY THEY NO LONGER CARE ABOUT LOVE.

"AMOR PROHIBIDO MURMURAN POR LAS CALLES POR QUE SOMOS DE DISTINTAS SOCIEDADES " WOWHappy to see how people still remember her. 

Have a feeling 1997 version would be better, just because of that overall feel of the movie was more aged and closer to 90s, and actresses looked more alike to the real Selena familyLove Selena but why are they make it seem like she loved singing and wanted to become a singer since she was a little girl? There’s so many interviews of her talking about how much she hated singing and practicing as a little girl. Her real dream was to be a fashion designer, that was her real dream!!! And her family didn’t support her. They didn’t even attend the opening of her boutiques!!! Smh

We will never see the real story of Selena as long as abraham is alive. Yes Selena was a humble and sweet person but she also has a wild side and Chris her husband is the only one who can tell us that

Also a lot of the scenes shown on this trailer look like they were just copied and pasted from the movie!! Selena lived 23 years and she did so many things like common show us something new!!OMG! I'AM STILL CRYING! 
ANYTHING FOR SALINAS! 💜🌹I said it once and I’ll say it again, if Selena was still alive today she would have surpassed singers like Madonna, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, etc. in terms of albums sold/popularity. She is a Legend!It's great to see, how Selena has become a...LEGEND! I watched the series, will watch ALL...SELENA🌹Selena was recently named "Greatest Female Latin Artist of All Time"  Gotta disagree. Selena is Greatest Artist of All Time, PERIOD. She had a combination of talent, charisma, stylistic versatility and class that was, and will always remain, incomparable - the reason why her music is pretty much all I've listened to for the last 23 years. The "artists" out there today will never be on her level, talent - wise, achievement - wise, or class - wise. To quote her sister Suzette in "Selena", "You're IT, girl"!  ❤👍👍❤Love this seriesI JUST DISCOVERED SELENA ....omg no words....God Bless her and her legacyI can't the movie without ending up w/ swollen eyes - all the feels, love her music.This gives me chillsSo excited for this series! Can’t wait! She is truly missed!I was skeptical about this I actually started to cringe during the first episode but the story is so good that I honestly got over the fact that the actors don’t resemble the actual person they’re playing. I got over the comparing of the movie vs the show. And I truly enjoyed it. Can’t wait to see the rest of the series.Makes me miss Selena all over again. 🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭I grew up with my mom always listening to her... 
ALOT of people don't know before jlo... there was SELENA!🤣😂
Q.E.D...she'd have so much positive power & influence over hispanic especially mexican communities...✌🏽🙏🏽I already have a lump in my throat 💜 this’ll be a beautiful tribute to her.The loss of Selena was years ago.  Yet I still have not completely forgiven the brutality and the insanity that caused her death.    I'm just starting to watch the Netflix series.   And I feel some pain.  But it is also a really great story.   I'm bot saying she and her family have a unique rise to stardom story.  I'm just saying it still hurt's a bit.  Selena and her family loss.Awww SELENA! Her story always makes me cry.Who else just finished the series and wants more showsOk I’m crying just because I was there as the Fresno fairgrounds back in the day, she was the Madonna of Texan Mexican American pop star. Rest in love and still to this day she is missed.I got goosebumps just watching this, I can’t waitThis seems like this will be a biography kinda but also a show like I can’t wait! I haven’t learned a lot about herI'm on episode 3 and sadly I'm having such a hard time seeing this actress as Selena. :( 
I love seeing Ricardo Antonio Chavira on screen again though. 😍I can’t wait to see this! It reminds me so much of the movieYess! Finally it’s coming out tomorrow!! 🙌🏼Anything for Selenaaaas!! ❤️glad that after all these years selena is still beloved and who knows maybe this will lead to a revival of tajano musicI love Christian Serratos!!! Great casting💗Really happy that we're keeping her memory alive.Gosh jlo did an AMAZING job portraying selena now that I think of it😭I appreciate her more! 👏🏻I can't wait to see this, I already seen the movie before so I am very very curious to see how this going to turn out and be like 😊.I’m watching idc I just love Selena always have since a little girl and always will!! I will always support this amazing heavenly star!I literally don’t understand the hate. Do you really expect her to look exactly like Selena? Because guess what, neither did JLO! In my opinion face wise, she looks way more like Selena than JLO, body not so much. But that’s what padding is for. The acting looks good, the production value looks good, the hair, and makeup look good. Just be grateful that we are going to see Selena’s legacy played out in a different way.All though I wasn't born yet when she was around I feel a strong connection with her through her songs. And I'm so happy people feel the way.As much as I love Selena's music, I  don't like the way that she was (and remains treated) as a cash grab by her father... obviously that's not something they are going to portray here because her family is involved in the production, but many people said that her father was SUPER toxic and literally treated her like a child. Selena had no autonomy! She had to get married secretly! Think about that!

Apparently, Guadalupe Esparza from the "Bronco" band (who worked with her on "Dos Mujeres, un Camino" a soap opera) said that Selena was very controlled by her father, so much so that Selena was always stressed and couldn't be herself... He said that Selena would only let go and be happy once her father would leave the set. 
If that's not toxic, I don't know what is.On the other hand, Gabrielle must be so proud of Carlos Solis for portraying Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla in these series. 😍Wooooow I got chills!❤️Well I guess I'm in the minority here but I really liked the mini series. Is she identical to Selena? No, but few people are but I enjoyed her interpretation and I'm glad we got to see more about the family and the rest of the band in this one. I also really liked the actor who played Abraham and he did pretty good especially considering he had to go after  Edward James Olmos.Knowing how this will end, I'm not sure how I feel . Excited or scared,  happy or sad. Angry. So many emotionsAll I can say is... Me siento muy... EXCITEDoof only she knows the weight of portraying Selena, because she’s just iconic to usjust finished the series on netflix it was very good and i am cryingIts soo krazy that Selena impact soo many people ...!! And it doesn't matter wat race u are or how old u are..!! Everybody loves her..!!! And there's not even one bad comment about her anywhere ..!! 💜💜I literally cried watching this such a beautiful soul gone to soon😢I don’t care about the Characters I care about the story I CANT WAIT😭❤️I really hope their next video is them playing a match wearing the inflatables in the backgroundWe all know football isn't Vik's greatest passion, but can we appreciate how he's always down to do footy challenges and get involved. Rate him a lot.Vik has that body language like we are keeping him from doing something more important.Sidemen vids always funny 😂A literal sidemen Sunday, now on a bigger stage, with a lot of extra ideas, now a more sidemen video. The evolution of sidemen videos over the past few years is honestly insaneTOBI DOING THAT TRICK SHOT IN WHITE PANTS MADE MY HEART DROP HOW IS THERE NO GRASS STAIN !!!!This used to be main channel content just shows the quality of sidemen nowIs it just me, but tobi’s drip is always clean afI think vikk should do a series of him doing football training but only reveals it after another sidemen football challenge where he smashes it lolVik has really came out of quarantine being an respectable football player! Vik was the most bullied for different things now he's showing them up!!! Go vik!!!!Tobi needs to be more appreciated for his fit every Sidmen video he always looking freshI see disc golf in the background. Let me know if you guys are down.tobi is unbelievably brave wearing an all white set near grass...Sidemen coming with sidemen Sunday content on a Tuesday
Gotta appreciate the hard workThe little pass from Tobi and the reception from Simon was so wholesomeI love how simon is beside vikk making sure jj doesnt break his collar bone again lol11:39 Tobi just casually being saucy with the ballTobi’s outfit is fire tho 🔥I love how Vik raises his arms whenever he accomplishes something"good team selection" LMAO JOSH IS A SAVAGETobi the only one to wear white bottoms and shoes on mud 😂😂Is it just me that find vikk raising his arms when hitting the dartboard so cute🎯Can we all just appreciate Tobis freestyle at 10:22?Been waiting ages for Football Darts to make a return!!!! so worth it :DI love the low effort of them in these videos. Like they aren’t trying too hard and it just brings a good chilled vibeThe Reddit’s gonna love JJ in this vid. Everything he did was a meme 😂13:22 Josh at the end: "good team selection" 😂 😂Can watch these all day and not get bored would love a day with them !!So jj goes from having the best no looker crossbar shot ever to thisVikstars the goat 🐐 and my favorite sidemen member ⭐️I am baffled by how Tobi managed to keep his cargo pants clean.awesome foot darts video sidemen you guys are just the best so keep making even more banger video content just like this one you rule lads!😎👍🏻🤘🏻Ethan and JJ laughing together is the best 🤣🤣🤣JJ: *Wins rock paper and scissors*
Also JJ: *Can't choose his team member first giving Harry an advantage*JJ is truly an athletic specimenInsane how the first 2 rounds were both 67-33. What’s more insane is that for this to happen the editor had to write 33 for jjs team in the first round when it was actually 32.At first I didn’t click cause I thought this was the old one. Nostalgic.props to the editors for editing these videos in the most beautiful wayHow hasn't Vik gotten better after 8 solid years, this mans jokes to watchTobi casually doing a sombrero flick at 11:39I can't get over Tobi's dripThe fact that this was once a main channel video shows how much the sidemen have grown.Sidemen put so much work into videos, I can't imagine how many hours per day they work.... main channels, second channels, live streams, sidemen channel, other sidemen channels like there just so much and I can see how exhausted they are but they pull through just to make us smile11:19 Tobi's cargo pants literally did not get affected by dropping hard on the ground even my black pants can't handle that.Simon hitting 6 with a rabona to get to 69 points is an all timerTwo JJ Video & a Sidemen Video
My day has been made PERFECTLYSomehow i saw VIKK being better than JJ at FOOTBALL?! 😂
Ethan shouting just makes it funnier as well😂The last time they did this video, Ethan and Josh were still fat, Vik was in a sling, Simon dating Talia wasn't public knowledge, JJ had just beaten Joe Weller in a boxing match, and Harry still actually uploaded on his main channel.I would love to see a video of them playing a round of disc golf lmaoProps to JJ for almost hitting the targetlets be honest, we all know that this was filmed on the same day as the Sidemen foot Golf, Tobi + Harry's outfits give it away11:39 no one gonna talk about how smooth that uncoordinated play was between Tobi and Simon?Can't wait to see their bubble soccer video if it comes outMy real concern is how Tobi didn't stain his cargos one bitI look forward to y'alls videos. Thank you for your dedicationThe fact that this is now more sidemen calibre is insane9:56 OMG I literally died laughing😂😂When Simon threw the ball to JJ and the music started playing, I really thought for a second he is going to score a bulls eye 😂😂😂Football videos never get oldYESS FINALLY AFTER SO MANY YEARS A PART 2i missed this so much i’m so glad the old sidemen are still hereJj hits a high score in the end of the video 

Ethan: i hope you choke on your next meal

Me: 😂😂🤣☠️JJ said he can knockout a horse 🐴 we all saw his accuracy 12:12JJ's shots were 'all over the place' 😂Josh was like the kid who got picked last but had the most talent😂😂😂😂When the music changes before vik takes a shot, it’s either going to be incredible or absolutely shitThe sidemen should do an actual darts challenge if they could get some official pdc players that would be awesomeyou know the sidemen sunday is going to be mad funny just by the backgroundStill remember the old football darts where they argued so much when one of them hit between a big and a small number 🤣Tobi doing the bicycle kick in all white made me ✨nervous✨Love how josh scored the most points in the first football darts and got picked lastI don't know why, but JJ picking Vik in his team was a wholesome moment right there...Simon doing bits with this channel! He’s so under ratedTobi's outfit in this vid is so good, like everything is colour coordinated. I love it!!JJ to Josh: he’s better than you
Also JJ: doesn’t even hit the target 
😂😂😂Vikk should teach JJ how to play football 😂Nostalgia ✨✨ it's been awhile since they made this type of videoIt’s a great day when the intro has the quiet moment where nobody knows what to doCan’t wait to see a match in those bubbles and a foot golf vidOnce upon a time this was a main channel video can we please just appreciate how far they’ve comeMan I just rewatched the old one now there's this one the nostalgia I'm experiencing right now!!!JJ a real one choosing his friends over skills for a team game 😂Tobi always has the best outfits 💯Only legends remember the first football darts video11:20 Harry calling Tobi Jay-Z made me burst outKSI: *brings together the bad players* 
Also KSI: *Does worse than Vik and Ethan *Sidemen football with random shoes like you’ve done years ago? I love football videos from you!JJ not trying is entertaining in itselfSimon: "Dammit we got Josh"


Oh how the times have changed from old Vik football videosThe "Good team selection" line by Josh at the end is gold.Finally we get another classic video 👍 they have so many Channels it’s impossible to keep up 😂Real darts would be a great laugh for a video 🎯🔥Anyone else wish they would do another charity match 😅JJ: let me show u how it’s done
JJ: completely misses 
JJ:😐You know their content has improved so much when what was a main channel video is now a second channel videoJust living life with the mates. I love yall guysJosh was the best in the first football darts video and still has the sauce. Still gets clowned on for being the joint worst thoThe reason i watch sidemen football is to see how vik doesI had 8:27 to 8:35 on repeat🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣that was soooo slickkkk From Tobi...I couldn’t stop laughingCan we appreciate how jj missed the dart board every timeVik: “Where do we go not to be in this video” I’m dead 💀Well we know that an upcoming sidemen Sunday is ‘Sidemen FootGolf’.. looking like it could be a bangerJJ was mad dumb, but you gotta admit he made this way funnier😂Josh at the end, “good team selection” 🤣🤣🤣This videos are so good they deserve main channelNext moresidemen bouta be a banger with the inflatables and footballSimon telling the other guys to let jj have a go again like an elder brother telling his friends to let his lil bro play😂❤️'Good team selection' Josh summed it up perfectlyKSI: You’re gassing over a double 2???

Also KSI: *proceeds to get 0*Omg another football darts 😂 i loved the old oneLoved this 🔥🔥🔥Tobi is out here looking like he is about to walk a steetfashion catwalk when playing football darts...Props to the editer for giving us hope 9:50Josh could the other teams whole combine score in two shots😂😂"Aye thats really close. We do winners take all" killed me😂😂😂Josh at the end : ‘good team selection’
😂😂Damn Tobi's outfit on point today9:58 I was so ready for a bullseye
the editors are taking the piss😭😭😭Josh with the "good team selection" at the end hahahahaToby dresses the best out of all sidemen💯you know JJ's true pain when he willingly offers us FATNEEK like thatHarry: *loses rock, paper, scissors*

Gets first pick, more players, and first kick

JJ: 3 take it or leave itI want to see these guys do disk golf, because aiming with the feet isn't going so well...ON EVERYTHING we need MoreSidemen vids to be longer. I know they work a lot but shit like this is just so easy to watch over and over again. The boys never fail to put a smile of my face.love it that Simon calls tobi 'tobes', love those two!Just think 3 or 4 years ago this would have been a main channel video. They have come so fari love how the editor trolls us by making us anticipate that jj would make the bulls eyeRemember when JJ knew how to kick a ball?💀Toby deserved a second try on that bike 🚲The nostalgia is kicking in now boys!!vic always shy and quiet when doing a challenge involving footballIf vikk hit that double 19, it would of been spoken about for the rest of time!Toby doing the scorpion all in white is pretty braveDid anyone else think they were getting recommended the old classic football darts at first 🤣Tobi is brave to fall on the grass in white clothesI feel JJ stitched himself up with his team 😂Love it how JJ wins ✊🏼🖐🏼✌🏼 but still ends up picking 2nd and missing out on either Simon or Tobi.
Only KSI would do that for suits & giggles 😂Exactly what I need to take my mind off today’s Barca game…even though josh was picked absolutely last he did better than EVERYONE on the other team lmfaoNo one :
Harry: "It kinda moves like my dad you know. "Next Sidemen Sunday looks fun 😃why does Harry say ‘can we agree no’ at the start as if people can cheat in Rock Paper Scissors 😂😂Would love to see sidemen go disc golfingBruh can we just take a minute to appreciate tobis drip every video. This man has the best fashion sense out of all the sidemenLoving these football videos🔥Judging by the props in the background, tomorrow’s video will be an inflatable zorb football match👏🏻🔥This looks extremely satisfying to playbased on the looks of this place, there are gonna be some BANGERS coming soonOk let’s be honest this game was over as soon as JJ was named captain😂😂😂I never seen karma hit someone harder LMAOnow we need vik in a sling for the complete throwback.Tobi's drip is unbeatableMan...vik is just so innocent... everything he does I feel sympathy for him for some reasonJosh at the end
"Good team selection"😂Fair play to Ethan, Vik and Tobi not wearing actual football bootsSo did JJ actually expect that kick at 6:20 to go anywhere? LmaoIs it just me or the way they chose the teams gave us nostalgia of going outside and playing with friends..😔😆And JJ used to do football videos back when he first started😂😭 mans hilarious at footballI love ittttt can’t wait for bubble soccerJJ is the Timo Werner of Sidemen FC 🤣The original football darts video was the reason I started watching Sidemen, big up.Josh "nice team selection" 😂😂😂😂😂🤣Toby always has a good drip,love his style the most tbh.Tobi gets chosen second to Simon all of the time but to be overall they are pretty even because tobi as a midfielder has more pace, endurance, and some same level skills as Simon. This is while Simon is very good at finishing, and some skill as a strikerEthan rocking the oversized shoes style😂Recreation of one of the funniest sidemen videos, legendary.Simon intros the vid 
"we are here today to do"
Tobi casually pointing to JJ with a smirk
I see KSIMONEveryone sayn this is now not main channel quality, shows how far sidemen have came they smashing it unlike anyone, gotta keep doing what they doingThe original football darts was genuinely one of my favorite sidemen sundays ever. Back in the day before all these new fans wanted more sets and high production, when the boys were just boys at the house.It’s very difficult to see JJ and Harry on the same team.1m views already damn 🔥 nothing better than watching more sidemenLove these type of videos!The old version was my favourite sidemen vid so this is gonna be goodWe need to see another sidemen got talentBefore I watch this, Josh was the MVP of the last sidemen football darts video. Will he be again?

Yes he willI see disc golf baskets in the background! The sidemen should try playing disc golf for a video! 🤣I love how Tobi always dresses in fully white but never gets dirtyWe want Vik as a team captain next time!I think JJ has completely forgot how to kick a ball xDWe know now they'll put another video of the bubble football from the same ground lol9:55 we have to appreciate the editor in this video, (look at the target when Simon throws the ball to JJ)this reminds me of quarantine when i went back and watched every sidemen videoTobi looking fresh in that fit  🔥🔥🔥Sad how at the end of round 2 jjs total was less than Harry’s Round 2 score 😂We just not gonna talk about Tobi's skills in the background? 10:20JJ is the only guy to lose while winning in rock paper scissorsJJ:yall are bad lemme show you how it’s done
Also JJ: *missesTobi's fits are insaneI think we all knew who was going to win once the teams were picked lmfaoI miss the punishment games where they actually try their best and under pressure.Sidemen in order of football talent (best to worst): Simon, Tobi, Harry, Ethan, Josh, Vikk, the tripod, the drone and then JJ10:51 greatest trickshot of all timeKSI  truly is the arsenal of Sidemen. King Tobi is the red devil of sidemenVan Dijk is playing football after 9 months and people going for his head after 1 mistake, some people are so desperate to make themselves believe that Van Dijk is washed up hahaha. He's really the best.I'm glad seeing minamino scoring a goal after that class assist by SalahIt’s good to seen VVD back I have missed him and I’m not even a Liverpool fana lot of positives to take from this. Great performance from all the lads. Youngsters had a great game, Salah was sharp, Minamino scored and Virg and Joey are backI
Don’t care how many mistakes me makes during pre season or ever I’m so happy to see Gomez and Virgil backEverybody: defending VVD cause haters insult him.
Me: doesn't see a single hate commentGreat to see Virgil and Gomez back 👏🏼 forget the mistake he’s gonna take us back on top this season ⚽️It's been a long time. Good to see Virgil and Joe back.Its pre season lads, minutes from the two centre backs was what we wanted to see, credit to berlin for winning this game.That Keita-Salah-Taki linkup goal was a thing of beauty.Was a good game. Greeting from Berlin 💙🤍we have so many chances,just lack of finishing,what a game and what a performance by young lads,heads up,keep going,you'll never walk alone❤️The tackle and pass by Keita, the backheel assist by Salah, and the class finish by Minamino 🎯🔥 That's what I like to see.Love seeing the lads on the pitch.  One of the few things that gives me pure joy these days.Not a Liverpool fan but it is genuinely so good to see Van Dijk back on the pitch. Him and Dias are going to be the two best CB's in the Premier league next season.So excited to see VVD back in action. It will take some time until he regains confidence and rhythm, but I trust him.Fantastic game!! Well done Berlin❤️❤️I was at the stadium, especially in the 2nd half Liverpool dominated. Berlin barely made it past the half way line. They were just very clinical with their chances.It’s good to see VVD back again! ❤️ I have missed him so MUCH!Well played. Teams looks like they are gaining fitness and getting their mojo back. A lot of first teams players still missing, and Hertha seemed to be at full strength. Better and better every match. Waited a long time to have Virgil and Joe back and now they're here. Y.N.W.A.Let them talk, we know how much we’ve missed him and everyone is worried, we’re coming for everything this seasonMuch support for the reds! This wasn’t mentioned by anyone here, but I also want to give credit to hertha. Well played and some spectacular goals all around.Good game by both teams 👍 Liverpool and Hertha scored some nice goals 👍Jovetic is a class player!We came off the blocks slow but once the 2nd goal was scored, we powered up the intensity and started playing heavy metal football. We could have won except that the mass  substitutions changed the momentum. But it was good for everyone to get minutes. Overall performance was good even in the loss. Keep at this and we will do well! 💣🔥🏆Naby Lad has been on fire so far this pre-season. I hope he stays fit for a long time because he's pure quality when he's on and our midfield could use someone like him after Gini's exit.Great match! As a United fan, I’m happy that VVD is back as it will bring more heat to the league🔥Good to see VVD, Gomez and Matip back. And also pleasure to see Minamino score as a Japanese fan. I hope we can use Konate and Matip as a main center back without injury and give VVD and Gomes time to regain their form.I am from Innsbruck and I was live at Tivoli-stadium, it was ah great thing seeing such a great team like Liverpool. Thanks for coming here.. :) Everyone was delightet about Van Dijk, there was no other player which got such applause like him, the audience celebrated every ball he touched.. :PI can't be the only one that is scared everytime Van Dijk makes a sprint or falls with fear he gonna do his knee in againHappy to see my two favorite clubs play against each other in such an entertaining matchI don't care if Vvd made a mistake in this match or not all I care about is seeing him back in the reds jersey after 9 months 😭😭💪 💪!!! Best Day of my lifeA truely spirited match!The big man is back
VVD👌🏽
I'm glad he has made a good recovery and I hope we'll see him back to his best soon
I really enjoyed watching him play during Liverpools premier league winning seasonI love both clubs, born and live in Berlin and following Liverpool closely ever since Klopp been there.

Great game from both teams, the dream would be to meet again in an international competition, although i doubt the BSC (Berlin sport club) will make it there :)It’s going to take time for VVD to get back into game shape. Not worried about him. I am concerned about our midfield. It needed to get better this summer and it has gotten worse. We are in desperate need of a creative, goal scoring midfielder.Glad to see VVD back, also glad to see fans being humbled for thinking he’s impossible to get through. Jovetic violated, granted he is just coming off a serious injury so it doesnt mean much.Great to see Virgil Van dijk Again we missed him so muchThat 2nd goal from herta berlin is astounding...was such a fun game to watch! loads of positives from most of the lads and the kids too. 

would be lying if i said i wasnt absolutely buzzing to see them all in action againThat salah assist was beautifulMuch support to Liverpool and Happy to see VVD and Gomez and Minamino backglad to see VVD is back. Hope he can catch up his tempo during preseason matches. Can't wait for EPL to start!That second goal was fire though, literally and figuratively 🔥🔥🔥🔥VVD positional play was amazing, I think he was overconfident that he was going to get that tackle in but suddenly realized what 9 months of not playing football does to you 😂 We forgive you big man can't wait to see back on the pitch every week, you will get that mojo backThank God VVD is back. I am jus glad to see this man on the pitch after 9 months.Petition for longer Liverpool highlights with replays of goals this season onwards
👇I'm not a Liverpool fan but it's nice to see VVD and Gomez backI'm happy to VVD and Joe Gomez comeback after long injuries. After 5 x 90 minutes, I think they can have a confidence and chemistry.

I believe in Kloppo.I'm just happy to see van dijk back in the fieldgood to see van dijk and gomez back in shape! credits to hertha for the dub, well deserved since our midfield looks like a mess right now. Our chance creation was average, nothing too special but I feel like Liverpool need to get someone whos gonna create because firminio's creation hasnt looked too great ever since the beginning of last season so i think we need to get Chiesa, who can really make something out of absolutely nothing, which is what we need exactly moving forward. Chiesa would be great but we need to look at the midfield. We need someone who would cooperate well with the likes of thiago, fabinho and henderson, maybe a more creative player who can still track back, like maybe aouar for example.I'm very excited for Tsimikas ahead of the season. I know it's just pre season but he is showing he'll be absolutely good cover for Robbo.I don't ever want to see this team again without VVD in the back.Man United fan here, but it's great to see Van Dijk back in action.beautiful goals were scored in this matchAs a man city fan! Best of luck to you guys. Im glad vvd is recovered.Come on, there's a lot of hope for this season💪(thrilling it is to see van dijk againWe love Liverpool!!! ❤️ So glad to see vvd and Gomez!!!People highlighting VVD's mistake, but actually before he fell, he showed that he still has pace - which is something you can lose after acl tear. I'm fairly optimistic.Joe Gomez is underrated bro he and virgil are the heart of the teamWhat a game some brilliant goalsHertha were sharper as they're two weeks ahead in their prep plus Jovetic loves a double against Liverpool! Fantastic to see both long term absentees return. Will do wonders for their confidence.great to see Virgil back 
season looking great for next seasonFINALLY VAN DIJK IS BACK 😍♥️You wouldn't need to remind me of O.Chambalerin's goal, he does what he does best❤️💯Love to see VVD on the pitch, hopefully his getting better.Glad to see VVD back on the pitch, good work of physios!!Honestly we were brilliant attacking and defensively solid at times, although we lost I’m happy with the performancenot the result we wanted but its really a good game. not a bad start for van dijk. minamino, keita and ox really perfomed well.Van Dijk is playing football with a perfect positinal playing. That's the way it has to be.Things you love to see VVD and Gomez 😊 can't wait for the new season ❤YNWALoved to see Ox score, not sure what Klopp has in mind for him but hoping for the bestChamberlain is one of those players that score rarely but they are amazing goalsIt will take a long time for Virgil to get back to his old level. He may not even reach that level again as ACL injuries can ruin careers, but whatever they outcome he will have our full support as Liverpool fansLiverpool have good ball handling. But Hertha have done very well in parts. Jovitic, just fetched from AS Monaco has immediately convinced. Hertha had Mans Problems the 2 last season. Nice to see that they are now back on track. Only the best for both clubs, which were founded in the same year.Good to see VVD and Gomez back🤩🔥🔥🤩That was a team goal, awesome job from keita, salah and minamino. I really like what I see from Elliot and Minamino. This season will be interesting.People going for Van Dijk’s head after one mistake on his return from a 9 month injury just proves how world class he is, give him time to readjust he’s not even had a full 90 minutes yet. He still even managed to get a shot on target.A bit odd to see vvd miss that tackle but im 100% sure he'll be as solid as before the injury. His positioning to make the tackle was spot on but the execution was off, nothing a few pre-season games wont fix. :>)The first and second goal are classic Liverpool! 🔥🔥🔥Not watering down how well Hertha played but it’s a friendly guys. It’s meant more for the manager and players to explore than anything else. Winning is a bonus but not the main point here. Playing well here does not translate to the league and vice versa of course.It's just pre season, we are winning the league ❤️I repeated almost 10 times that move of VVD wanted to stand up firster then seeing Roberson swimming there was no hope of making it.. the injury was massive it will take him time to performHey guys easy! This is the friendly match and the first time for VVD to play the game after the long recovery time.
Not matter how the result is, it really excited to see he comes back!good to see VVD and Gomez back. pretty much the only reason Liverpool didn't win the EPL and CL last season.Glad to see VVD back.. although he had a shockerI think everyone had to hold their breath for a moment when Van Dijk slid across the ground like thatMinamino and Ox deserve some game time this season...Hopefully no long term injury for OxGood to see VVD playing for Liverpool again 👍Credit to Berlin they played their socks off. Their second and fourth goals were well worked and likewise with liverpool's second. Good for vvd and gomez to get their rustiness our of the system so they can be ready by the Norwich game.veo a van dijk muy poco fino por ese error aunque es entendible ya que vuelve de su lesion ojala regrese como siempre un crackThat berlin second goal was massiveThe way I look at VVD being back is the way I want someone to look at me.Just noticed vvd little scared to go for the tackle maybe because he came from an injury. But vvd needs to be slowly integrated into the team. I would go with matip and konate for the start of the season.defenders back from injury aside… our ATTACK is 😍So happy to see VVD & Joe Back😁😁😁😁. Ahhh things you love to see❤Well Done Liverpool, Good Match. Loosing just shows what you need to work on for next time! ⭐Liverpool fan but that goal was fantastic by BerlinEven though we lost..There are some positives we can take from this performance like minamino getting he's form back and mane and salah are sharpVan Dijk got absolutely spun on that last Berlin goal 🌪😳😂Great to see van dijk and gomez backFor anyone saying van dijk is washed up,last year I broke my arm and after 3 months I was so scared to even touch a football ball. It took me a couple of weeks to start going again. I think van dijk is afraid that he will get injured again so give him time to recover.YNWA ❤️❤️ doesn't matter win or lose

We are Liverpool 🔥

It's nice to see my idol Virgil Van Dijk is back 🔥🔥🔥Tsimikas hella underrated. Keita is has been immense and should start next to Fab and Thiago. Very excited to see VVD back in action!Good performance lads ❤️Nice to see VVD back, he’ll be back to his best, don’t know why everyone is saying “he’s finished”🤦🏾‍♂️Even with a weakened acl Virgil still sprinted like a madmanclear to see Van Dijk was taking it easy there, no point going into hard to a challenge right after 9 months out ina friendlyGreat to see VVD back but it's going to take a few months for him to get peak form back and the rustiness out of his system!VVD it’s good to have you back it’s baby steps we all know you coming backWelcome back Van Dijk !!!Wow Jovetic 🔥We back to the 2016 Liverpool again! Goals for dayssseven I who saw it was afraid to see Van Dijk run 😢1:04 usually this works for VVD Aha 
Still I’m glad he’s back, iv honestly missed him.We did not have Alison in net VVD and Gomez trying to get back in full form and did not have our normal lineup and we did pretty good if I gotta be honest but I hope Adrian can develop more.cut virgil some slack he made a mistake after not playing for 9 months he’s still the best in the league just give the guy a chance2nd goal of bsc is amazing. Like Van Basten's Goal.VVD...keep it up coming, you missed a step that let you down, the boy could have not score. We are liverpool 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻✌🏻Even Van Dijk are not good a bit but a pleasure to see him on the pitchJovetic has always been a class player.Happy to see VVD back on the field.Tsimikas, Ox, Naby, Elliott, Minamino are looking dangerous for this seasonI am not disturbed by the loss but how VVD was down in that tussle for goal makes me anxiousJovetic tho🔥 scoring on Liverpool like the old days 😳Good game…pre season is all about game minutes…a lot of positives things to take..surely we’ll be ready and fit to challange the titles this season…Come on Reds..YNWAI was so afraid VVD would get injured again going for the sliding challenge for the 4th Hertha goal.I TOLD Y'ALL that once Taki got to play with starters instead of academy kids + Origi the guy we saw in all those training videos would turn up.  
Not a coincidence that players have better performances when they have better teammates. We all know Origi is a Liverpool hero, but he simply doesn't offer enough movement anymore.Great to see Big virg on the pitch😍😍🔥🔥.. One mistake he would be great and better as before🔥🔥Desperately praying that this injury dosen't affect Vvd too much. Ppl are already placing too much hopes on the team winning the league this season cuz he's back but it's gonna take some time for him to actually regain his form. Just need him to stay fit for the time being. Oh and this applies to Keita as well.I dont think we will the best of virgil and Gomez until new year they need time just glad they are backNot bothered by the lost, in actual fact, we looked sharp. VVD isn't at his best yet after a lengthy layoff, but so would anyone else after that amount of time without a matchVirgil van Dijk, back on WORK! ⚽️❤️💪🏼All friendlies nothing to worry about...this is a good thing ...Now they can work on where they need to be aggressive and smart.. GG LFC its comingGreat to see Van Dijk back 😂😂😂No Problem, Van Dijk. Still believe in youVVD is a one season wonderGood to see VVD BACK ! 
From a manu fan 🤝🏻❤When VVD slipped I was thinking he did the ACL againSo happy to see Virgil AND Joey G backVirgil missing tackle = Calm
Virgil falling on knee  = PanicGo to see VVD back in the pitch ❤️❤️🔥💯Ox goal just wow!! Nothing can sayI'm glad that, Liverpool this season will come back to its normal standard...and will be humbled...like a ham between city and ChelseaBeautiful hit from Ox tho👌👌Welcome back VVD and Gomez 👍👍💪Not the best start for the season but still friendly matches we don't have to be worriedIts clearly visible, Van djik didn't tried much before sliding late..as he don't wanna risk a recurrence of an injury in a friendly...but surely when the season starts, he's going to show who is the best CB in Europe...Oh my god !!!!!!!!
VVD and Joe are back !!!!🥲🥲🥲
And Taki scored!!!!!!!!!
Although Liverpool lost , i'm really happy(≧∇≦)See, Minamino gonna be class this season if gets time! C'mon taki!! We're here for you!Nice pre season experience.. Need more additional player with a bunch of qualityglad to see Vvd back on the pitch after so longWelcome back BIG Virg and Joe! 😍🙌🔥 Great work, Reds! 🔴👏Welcome back Virg and Joe. We will win the league.Came for van dijk, stayed for minamino 😎Best of luck my heart Liverpool club go ahead ❤We can't expect more from VVD I really feel sad for him the goal that he let on is not his mistake. He just started after an injury that led to 10 months or so. I am really glad to see VVD and JG play together it's just the start.


YNWAEveryone saying it's pre season, it's also pre season for them, not just us 👍🏼Welcome back VandijkA lot of positives tonight reds 🔥 we lost but it’s about fitness really !Come on gents,  we can do this 💯This result seems like from another universum where Hertha is actually a good team loolIf Sarah can provide more of those assists, I am certain Liverpool will win even more games….He is a great scorer, but just needs to know when to pass sometimes….Like I said on the other vid about klopps reaction it’s Great for Virgil and Gomez to get minutes back on the pitch especially when we have waited so long for their return but now focus on training and the next match YNWAI’m soooo happy to see Tsimikas playing!!!!!Let Henderson back to the team 🔥i love seeing Ox and Minamino ... make sure they are still in liver next season please.JFT97
Nice to see Virgil and Joe back, We miss them, Taki lovely goal. YNWAIt’s great to see Virgil back can’t wait to see Dias vs Varane vs Van dijk- Man U fanVirgil was scared to go for the tackle and it had me worried for himJoe put VVD in that situation. Shouldn't have thrown himself into the challenge.

Look at the replay. Its good defending on a 2 v 1 but a little unfortunate as he tripped himself during the attempt to get the ball. You can see him pointing to the spot.Excited to see Kostas and Elliott in actionSalah was masterclass today 👏The way minamino score I feel like watching Maria Ozawa 💪Van  dijik is back from injuries and he is only gaining his form. Pls don't eat his head for one mistake he has done. Let him have a come back to his potential. He is true hardworking human..Obviously, Van dijk and Gomez both need to play as much as possible and regain their feelings. But it will come!Hertha played very wellHe's our centre half, He's our number 4, Watch him defend and watch him score, he'll pass the ball long as you like,  he's virgil Van Dijk. he's Virgil van dijk. 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🔥🔥🔥Normally after having long term injuries player will be abit cautious... it take time to be more confident.1:08 No Virgil not you 😢

But I still believe you the best defender ❤️Minamino is superb . Vvd will find his form by playing more matches . Let's go liverpoolLiverpool a true club. They always upload highlights even if they do loose the matchYAYYY VAN DIJK COME BACK 🥳🥳keep going lads🔥❤️Liverpool have a nice match , even though they lost they will be in full force .
👍👍👍👍👍👍Minamino could be like a new signing this season now that he should be adapted. Think that little loan spell at Southampton will have done him the world of good. And some people need to chill out. It's pre-season. If this was a competitive game we would pump Hertha, no disrespect to them.good game VVD, don't push yourself over a friendly matchVan Dijk is going to show us some comedy skills this season lolTsimikas's performances shows that Robbo will finally have some time to restHarvey Elliot is really starting to shine, and grow in confidence, good luck to him and I hope he gets as many minutes possible in the league.🔴🔴🔴That Injury has changed Van dijk 😩😭Naby been lookin really good this PreseasonHappy to see VVD backLet them talk, we know how much we’ve missed him and everyone is worried, we’re coming for everything this seasonI can't be the only one that is scared everytime Van Dijk makes a sprint or falls with fear he gonna do his knee in againGet a too easy hoodie - https://tooeasy.shop I've created a high quality brand, made ethically and entirely in USA.

Literally every farmer to ever exist “angry breathing”“Who the heck is buying this stuff”



Me: having goats 😃“Who the heck is buying this stuff”

The dozens of people who own farms:“Who the heck is buying this stuff?”

As an individual who owns horses and rabbits, I would say I’m pretty well acquainted with the task of buying hay.As a person who frequently buys hay, it’s normally for livestock and poultry like cows chickens and ducks. So to answer your question, that’s why it’s so easy to buy hay.
Edit: yeah also small animals such as guinea pigs and rabbits
Edit2: some animals eat hay, and others may just use it as bedding. Like my chickens use it as bedding, but some animals like horses might eat it.
Edit3: I forgot that hay and straw aren’t the same thing. Hay is used for food for animals like horses but straw is used for beddingNow he has a case of itchy handsTechnically that wasn’t finding a needle in a haystack, it was finding a needle in a bale of hay.  That’s a small bale too, compared to some of the bales being made today.  To qualify as a proper haystack I think you’d need at least ten bails of the size you used, or up to 50 or more for a substantial haystack.  The old saying was coined before the common practice of bailing hay.“Who the heck is buying this stuff”
*Farmers: I’m all an illusion* 🤠👍"who needs to buy hay bales" is probably one of the most privileged person question I've heard in a while.İmagine being rock having no idea this person exists but he declares you his nemesis"Who the heck is buying this stuff!?!"

Farmers

Farmers are buying itIsaiah: I mean who buys this stuff?
Farmers: we don’t exist according to this guy.“Who the heck is buying this stuff?” 
Literally every farmer ever, it amazes me that some people are just so disconnected from the rest of the world…“Who buys hay anyway?”

Farmers: I- wha- 

The animals: what do you think we eat-
😔✋"Who the heck is buying this stuff?"
me: *looks at the barn I take riding lessons at*“Who the heck is buying this stuff?”
Farmers: “So i just don’t exist anymore?”👩‍🌾A lot of people work in the agriculture business. Hay is used to feed livestock, as bedding, and to keep barns or sheds dry. Hay is important in a lot of people’s scenarios so it is easy to acquire although most people don’t purchase hay from a store, they either bale their own fields or buy from another local that bales.the smaller sections are called flakes, the whole hay bale is just multiple flakes compressed together. you would normally feed a farm animal two flakes for one meal.“It’s easy to find hey like who’s buying this?”

You Californians are so out of touch with reality. 😂I buy hay monthly for my mice and rats it's a fun foraging thing for them and makes their cage look more natural and they could technically eat it if they wanted to, I also bought hay weekly when I had guinea pigs 😅 it was also used in my old barn cats shelter since she was feral as bedding.Isaiah: “Like who the heck is buying this stuff”

everglow never disappointsThey are still so underrated. They never make bad music and deserve so much betterI'm a silent fan of everglow, and I can't accept the fact that they haven't getting THAT recognition. They're not underated nor overrated but I'm still craving for their song to be known. All of their songs are top tier, and never disappoint.I am officially addicted to this songEverglow really never disappoints with the comebacks and concepts.

Realmente Everglow nunca decepciona con los comebacks y conceptos.Let's face it they continue to be a hit with every comeback they're a real queeneverglow is a complete group. it has excellent vocalists, dancers, rappers and visuals.

Apoyando a las chicas como se debe!! #StanEverglow ♡_♡oh wow this song is so interesting. especially how its arranged & structuredI feel like Everglow and Loona are those groups that are more famous outside Korea, but whenever they make a comeback, it's always satisfying to the eyes and ears. Both groups are versatile in terms of musicality, and while Loona is obviously synchronized, Everglow is surprisingly synchronized too.

*Orbit here to support Everglow and the Forevers*Everglow es el grupo 10\10 del kpop, no falla, no decepciona, no necesita repetir conceptos para mantenerse en lo alto.What i love with Everglow is that they are talking to girls, about empowerment and dream !!

This is genuinely groundbreakingI want E:U to rap more. She is talented, she should have shown her potential.everglow never fails to amaze me ! the visuals, catchy melody, and their dance are wowowowowowThis song is giving a 2010s pop song vibe and I’m here for it!!!!!!They really never disappoint, and I don’t say that lightly.It’s not like full-on empowering, but I would be lying if this isn’t a BIG BOP! I can already see myself dancing around with this song and it’s only my 1st listen. EVERGLOW FOREVER LET’S GO!*DO EVERGLOW HAVE A BAD SONG??*
The answer is NO… this slaps so hard!! 

The production value of this whole comeback is insane."girls all around the  world"
"we can be anything"

I'm not a forever (are they worth stanning, plz let me know) but as a female these lines are just so damn powerful!their comeback is always mind blowingeverglow's stylists deserve a big raise for their styling on this everglow's comeback they're literally on another level with everglow's styling and everglow's dance and vocals are the biggest power in their mv's for meOkay but that “girls all over the world” part with sihyeon’s vocals, is giving me literal goosebumps!

Salute to everyone who worked hard for this.I'd really like to see Everglow in Queendom.

Their songs are a masterpiece ♡Sihyeon's "Girls all over the world" is so iconic"i'm the winner, winner, winner"
LET'S GO FOREVER, EVERGLOW DESERVE IT.Onda did not have many lines yet she stood out a lot. Her visuals and the hair, the styling were gorgeous. Everglow never disappoints.Mia's facial expressions and charisma are mind-blowing. She was born to be an idol👏Most badass girl songs are about how girls dont need men or love this, love that- (dont get me wrong I love that concept and jam out to songs like that too) but I love how this is just about pure girl power.  In kpop I believe- the first of its kind, a bop too! I really hope this becomes a hit and reaches girls all over the world so togther we can all become pirates! I also loved how weach member had this special badass trait about them that was different so, when girls see this they know to be awesome and a badass, you dont all have to be the same type of baddie! You can be different ant there's space for all of you! So Everglow fighting! And lets try to reach the top with this song! 
<3
edit:
as a female, I didn't mean to say that songs about not needing men are bad or invalid, I just meant to say that I really like how this song is purely about girls being girls, and how I liked that. I'm so sorry if my words offended anyone, and if you want this comment to be deleted I will :). I really didn't mean to say that women not needing men songs are bad or not needed-  I  said that most girl-power songs are like that , and how I just liked how this one was purely about girls, no men thought about, no love or ex-lover. and, when i said first of its kind, I meant that its the first time I heard about a song like this! I'm sorry and I do understand that they are more songs like this.
<3let us all not ignore the fact that these girls came back, giving women all the strength and power we need for a boost through a song, *again.* such queens deserve more appreciation and respect, they earned it.I literally can't stop playing this song ever since last weekAisha's dance,  Yiren's beauty, Onda's charisma, Sihyeon's voice, Mia's stage presence and e:u's rap. 

My favorite moments are Sihyeon and Onda's parts. This is Sihyeon's era.Everything Everglow does becomes addictive to everyone, Everglow is a Queen.No me arrepiento de stanear a este grupo maravilloso ,la música,los escenarios, simplemente perfecciónMe gusta como sobresalen, cada una de ellas tiene un toque que te deja sorprendida y yo andaba grite y grite  todas están divinas soy lagrimas :")♡♡♡♡Everglow nunca decepciona.

No, it wasn't planned.The fact the audi beat them with 1 completely dead cylinder is the highlight after it demolished the cop chase lmao.Watching Tyler drive like a maniac was hilarious.  Freddy legit had concern in his eyes.  Ed cool as a cucumber in the back seat.Freddy doesn't just unplug your coil, he takes the whole damn thing! 😂On Tonight's Episode of Car Trek:
Tyler chauffeurs the boys;
Ed gets arrested;
Freddie drives on grass;
and a Mercedes goes for a stroll.It feels like I'm watching the next topgear growing up. Really outstanding series guys and thanks autotempest for putting your faith and money behind these great content creators.Hold on Jerry!Even with one coil pulled out that S4 did it’s thang gotta love an S4.Ed: If he got any points on his license, he would go bankrupt
Tyler: I’m already bankruptI can feel Tavarish’s frustration after he blew his tire on the track :(.  He can’t catch a break on any of the episodes of car trek hahaha.God I love how hoovey just rear ends tav’s car and don’t care at all LMFAO. 
He will just call Maaco to fix it LMFAOTyler's car rolling back into the guard rail on pit lane was hysterical! I've been to AMP about two dozen times and they are notorious for charging an arm and a leg for hitting the guard rail. Some I'm curious, how much did Tyler's stunt cost?Tyler's face while taxi-driving the rest of the crew around the track at the beginning was hysterical.This episode was by far my favorite of the entire Series! And Tyler’s wagon running away will be in CarTrek highlight reels for all eternity.The fact that ed played along with getting pulled over, and having a kid arrest him is pure gold.Tyler going FULL SEND in a diesel station wagon gave me so much joy todayi wanna say, whoever picked the soundtrack for the cop chases NAILED IT. it was spot on early NFS, like right around the og hot pursuit.

also ill give freddy some credit, on that right hander the car DOES get light and its really easy to spin a rwd car.whoever was flying the drone and filming did a great job - well doneI follow all three guys on YT, but seeing the very determined and focused side of Tyler during the chauffeur trip was crazy. He threw that car around in a way I've never seen him do. Ed has 100% run from the cops before and he was chill and cavalier as usual. Freddy always brings the joy out of everyone and everything, so much so that we all feel like we are his best buddies. This was such a great episode and i always look forward to every episode.Ed is just flying in the back when Tyler is driving 😂😂Having owned, and still own an SLS, I agree with Freddy about the shifts on the SLS. They were painfully slow from the factory.  BUT, there is a software update that any Mercedes dealership can perform.  Once you do the $200 software update, it's amazingly faster.  Even the tech at the dealership was shocked by the difference.  Get the update Tyler!





I can't believe the steel brakes on the SLS could be that bad.  I have the ceramics and they're insanely grippy.  I think the steel ones are the same diameter, just over 16 inches up front!  So there must be crap pads in that car.





Tyler, upgrade the interior with the factory carbon fiber.  It's so much better than the aluminum and you can find them for ~$3k.  It's sad the only CF in the car is that ugly steering wheel.  If you can find it, the carbon fiber engine bay is gorgeous.  But those are a needle in a haystack to find and people ask crazy money (~10k).Jerry is a legend for being able to clear up most of those antsI love how Ed's Lambo has basically the same steering wheel as the AudiEpic and phenomenal car trek series pure enjoyment with Ed, Hoovie, and TarishEd just proved time and time again, it isn't always the car, it's the driver.Seeing the 300TD on the track made me cry of happiness, seeing a car like that shine again made my day, thank you guys :)Thank y'all for making this. Absolutely wonderful production qualityRestoring your first car, can be a good sub plot for Car Trek Season 6i look forward to these so much.. the editing, the style and the ideas just get better and better :D

S6 is gonna be awesomeThe challenge of running from the cops on the track brought out a similar joy in Ed to getting to drive the F1!Ed sounds like like a Driver’s Ed teacher with the way he’s just chilling in the back seat giving a very calm voice giving Tyler directions around the Track. I guess we can call him Driver’s Ed now. 😂🤣Loving the content serious old school top gear vibes thank you all for what ya do.👍 Seriously entertaining!Car trek is a wonderful show you guys just constantly evolve to become an even better show. Thanks for all your hard work!Please never stop making car trek. This is better than any show on televisionLove it! AMP is such a fun track.  Very jealous of a day out with especially your dream cars, but even a crap-basket would be fun around there with the elevation changes and turn variety. Anybody timing laps? ;)Each season and episode gets better than the last.  The police chase was awesome, but stealing the coil, absolutely epic. 🤣🤣🤣You guys are like the American version of the OG TopGear - Clarkson (Freddy), Hamster (Hoovie) and May (Ed) - great episode guys!Wow. Seriously, each series is getting better and more creative. Just outstanding content!When Freddie pulled the coil he effectively turned an S4 into an RS3 😂This episode is very fun to watch. The entire season has an upbeat vibe that I like. Old broken cars with too many problems can become a bit boring.You guys have so much fun driving cars its fun to watch. Thanks for the laugh when Tyler was doing donuts in the parking lot!My dad had a Superbird with the hemi back in the 70's. He was able to lose the cops but they had units waiting for him at his house when he got home.  He always told me no matter how fast your car is,  you'll never outrun a radio lolYou guys deserve a prime time slot on television.I absolutely did not take the cars out for any laps the night before, not at all…Great content, great production value and the amazing dynamic between these 3 is the recipe that made Top gear UK awesome! Top gear USA should reboot using these 3, it’s way better than what they were putting out before.I love how you guys got together and bringing back childhood top gear vibes. Modern day top gear because the new one sucks. Thank you for the awesome videos I hope you guys keep this up and don’t stopMad props to the drone operator at the track. Those shots were amazing!Love the Car Trek series. Oe of, if not the best automotive series I’ve watched. Love AutoTempest for making it continuously possible. After hearing about it on the channel, I was able to purchase my current car (16’ Lexus IS350 F sport) about a year ago through AutoTempest.This show is looking more and more like the OG Top Gear, by the season!! Great going guys!!Those twin turbo v6 rs4's, even in wagon form, were and still are a force to be reckoned with mannLove the fact that they're taking kids to a race track to get practice for future pursuits. Keep up the content and good work guys.....in my heart I know you guys aren't a$$holes and I appreciate it!!!! Also just FYI an original 66 ac cobra could dust one😂😂😂You guys are so nailing this out of the park I'm dying laughing with you guys every episode ❤️❤️❤️I despise insects and just the thought of touching the inside of Ed's car makes my skin crawl...

...but somehow, you made me fall in love with Jerry and the boys. I hope they didn't overdo it on the chips and vomit during the race.A appreciative Ed's "Wheee" everytime it happensThis show is awesome. I can't wait to see more!New subscriber 💌
. Great content .. Mad respect to the drone operator 😍I am loving these series!! Thanks guys!!Two things that really surprised me, the way Tavarish runs,  and the way the Audi S4 kept going without and ignition coil.This series truly bring me joy. Not just this season, but this entire project. It’s been really satisfying to watch these dudes grow their channels and build their careers to be able to do this. You guys are living the dream! Good friends, cool cars, fantastic roads. Keep them coming y’all 🤜🏻🤛🏻I have the strongest desire to call Hoovie "Magoo" when he's behind the wheel of that wagon.Well done boys. That’s some quality entertainment right there.Absolutely the best! Laughter and entertainment, par excellence. Great job guys!An awesome Idea for a series would doing off-road resto-moding to your first cars then testing them out. I have a feeling Tavarish wouldn't like the idea much though 🤣Ed just gave the public a good car choice to use in a get away car chase with the cops 😅I wish these episodes were an hour long! Best car series I’ve seen since OG Top Gear💯 Keep it up guys yall are killing itI just love you guys having fun on the road, so much fun to watch, and I'm not even mad about it..This series is epicThis is such a good series.  Its like Top Gear but its actually funny and they're actually car guysI’m excited to find out what Ed’s favorite road is, so I can also drive there!I love when he bumps the Mercedes into the back of the Maxima gets out before it even stops moving and it starts rolling backwards, drives back up and bumps the maxima again.😂 pure comedy😂That intense drone footage during the pursuits was EPIC!The runaway diesel was hilarious. Love watching those dream cars tear up the track. Keep these Car Trek (autoTepest) videos coming!!!!Thanks for another brilliantly entertaining episode!quality programming guys, keep them coming!Tyler's car rolling was hilarious. The Car was like I'm outs see you later Tyler  😅Amazing. The series, the eps, the camaraderie, the story telling, the friendships, the challenges, the situations, everything, ALL gets better as you guys make more of these! Love it, new age Top Gear adventures 😃 I hope y’all can continue forever. Never stop, this is a great trio.I LIVE fir these shows/series!!! Seriously, never since Top Gear (TG)  has there been a more interesting treo of guys that not just do as good, but do it better than the TG boys, and they don’t have to be in Antarctica or in the middle of Africa to do it! I CANNOF WAIT to see how this turns out! Meanwhile…I am using the tips and tricks from this show to find my next ‘project’ even with all of the inflation. When you have a platform this large, you ALWAYS have the one you want and can get it at the price you want. Just takes time, research and negotiation. That’s it. Thanks to everyone including the production crew! You all are awesome!Love all your videos learned alot super fun series thanks 😊 👍 😀 🙏 ☺Great series guys! Here’s a suggestion for season 6: Buy used cars for a purpose, have a budget to restore / modify themSeeing the tire sidewall fold under on the Mercedes is amazing 😂😂😂. Good work boys.Loved it!  Bring on more!  Very entertaining!LOVE YOUR VIDEOS, BEEN WITH YOU ALL SINCE THE START. YOU MADE MY DAY WITH THIS VIDEO :) BIG FAN! I GOT A CAR I ALWAYS WANTED AND YOU GUYS MADE ME BELIVE IN DREAMS, I WAITED ABOUT ONE YEAR FOR THE PERFECT SPEC AND ENGINE, GREATINGS NIKLAS IN NORWAY. HAVE A GOOD DAYThis season of car trek is hands down the best!  The cop chase reminds me of need for speed hot pursuit.Loved this episode!! Please keep doing Car Trek!!!I actually thought it would be set a time in your first car, then set a time in your dream car, and the biggest improovement wins.
Also, the old 300TD is probably the only car there, not getting anything damaged rolling into the guard rails.The fact that the cops chose to bring a pickup is telling.This is one of the best episodes of Top Gear America ever.Dude I was giggling from beginning to end! Definitely gotta watch the rest of the episodes!Seeing these guys run is probably the highlight of the entire series haha.I was cracking up at the the Mercedes going around the track. The broke windshield wipers made it look like it was flying!Always love seeing a track I’m familiar with! Love doing AMP in my Miata.Honestly you guys feel like the next generation of top gear. Richard Hammond Jeremy Clarkson and James May honestly are getting on in years and why I love them to death and I will always watch their content. you guys should be the next incarnationI de-beaded a tire once doing my best Alonso impression (the defensive weaving) in something about half the mass of that TD Merc.  Hats off to Tyler actually, for keeping all 4 wheels on the car inflated for that lap.🤣 This is the best episode of "Discount Top Gear" yet!!! Excellent job guys 👍👍👍😊Loving the show, becoming the freshest since the other 3 guys in amazon :)It was the best episode so far. Running Ed Bolian run is something out of the world to see(weird)😂😂😂Somewhat cheesy, but I LOVE EVERY SINGLE SECOND!!!!  Scale 1 to 10....an  easy 11!  Good job guys! 😎“Come on DBS, you’re made for this” 

Proceeds to simultaneously understeer and oversteer then spin 
LoooollThe chemistry between these fools is perfect.I love these shows. Keep them up.I absolutely enjoyed this series 🏁💥This would be so much fun to do!! Everyone's local pd should sponsor something like this it would get people off the streets and make something fun for people to do!!!Whoever is flying that drone is doing great...🔥🔥Every season is better, good job guysTavarish was truly scared when Tyler was driving them around the track.I'm a huge Top Gear fan [British and American] and this is deff giving them a run for their money.  Keep it up guys!They really have gotten good at this. Great work guys. Might even consider subscribing to Tavarish.I love how the tires on the 300 almost came off of the rims around the track 🤣Excellent episode! The little sabotage was so cool! 🤘TEXAS!!!This production quality is top notch, best episode"It's nice to let 'em win one once in awhile, doin' it for the kids!" I love Ed and his massive egoThat truck is fast and takes the corners well!! Didn't expect that...We need more of the misadventures of Hoovie and his wagon, I absolutely love the complete disregard he has for that carLove this series!! You guys are definitely at the top of the list for one of the best car shows available.
There’s CarTrek & those fella’s we all know on Amazon. 
Your channels are going to struggle because I want more CarTrek. 😅🤷‍♂️Make no mistake if freddy's murci or gallardo were to make an appearance in the dream car section there would be very little chance of him losing, beyond him not wanting to push the either one of them.Love to see more "average cars" on car trek!!This whole production is just TOO good for YouTube. I’d happily pay a subscription to watch these for more episodes! 

Well done guys!3:18 the front drivers tire is an inch away from the rim 😳 holy crap lol.....makes me wonder how much more force it would take to break the seal....nice driving!!Tavarish is missing the Metallica CD  for the police chase. And im so glad we get more first car content.I’ve watched every carTrek! Amazing content!Great series of videos 👍 
Reminded me of the old top gear on BBC.I love the whole a Top Gear parody theyve got going on here, its almost as good as the real thing, I love this seriesHow can Freddy be such a bad driver it's so funny to watch Ed Drive circles around these guysFor the first time in car trek, ed’s actually winning consistently. 


Nice!!!! 😃I love that Freddy almost goes for the murci but decides not to and its hilariousBest episode! Fantastic guys, super funAnother amazing episode my guys!!!!I love the low speed chase after watching the beads almost break on the tiresThe rear view mirror in Tyler's car is classic LOLMy first car was a Dodge Daytona Turbo 5sp. 174hp, if memory serves. 😄
It would have been fun to run with these guys, though there's no way i would have caught the Audi. 😄

My HS vehicle was a 1969 Chevy C10 with a 327 V8. Wouldn't win either, but it sounded great. LolI just got a new job at an international dealer, so I totally missed this debut. Congrats guys!!!CarTrek idea: The boys use AutoTempest to buy ONE car, all drive in the same car together, get to a new city on their route, then have to buy a new car to travel in, and then repeatagain further along the journey. 
However, each car is selected by each of the guys, so Hoovie picks car 1, Ed car 2, Freddie car 3.The bodyroll and 14 inch rims hurt the W123 handling badly. There are people making stiffer swaybars for these cars, as well as rear camber kits to allow fine tuning the alignment for optimal handling, now making more power can be a challenge, Maintenance goes a long way in restoring it to the original 120ish hp, OM606 nozzles add some more, from there some IP mods and wastegate adjustment makes them pretty snappy, maybe not going to keep up with a S4, but plenty to outrun an ecoboost...2:41 I love that the original mud flap - with the beautiful Mercedes-Benz logo - is still holding on 😆Damn Tyler got lucky the door closed instead of being pulled further openThis series is amazing. So funny !Great Episode, Loved the Police Chase, the Winning Sabotage, and the spinout lol + the wild granny car swaying all over trackdying laughing the fact that I currently own a built 2003 maxima had out ran the police in my b5 s4 multiple times and just finished building my 04 sti because the Audi didn't have the potential has me loving this video if you have something that will out preform a police car you had better know how to drive itAs far as my experience in LE, the F-150 police trucks were never rated for pursuits and couldn’t participate but an interesting watch!I would love an off-road / overland episode“This is definitely a momentum car” lmao Tyler gotta be the funniest and half the time it’s unintentional he’s just being himselfLove Car Trek - such a brilliant series.Safe to say, Ed had some experience here 😂I’m amazed how the Mercs tire did not get demolished after that turn at 3:16Man my guy Freddy even pulled out Ed’s coil and he still won. Lol.The Maxima actually WAS known for great handling, and I dont think any pickup truck no matter how powerful would catch it on a curvy racetrack.It was so magnanimous of Freddie to spin out intentionally just to make his friends feel better. It must be hard being so superior all the time, occasionally you just have to let others feel like they measure up. Your benevolence is truly admirable.Great show guys! Beats Top Gear by miles!Bought a B5 S4 a few months ago, absolute beast of a car, ahead of its timeThe Merc has excellent handling 😃Ed looked too natural in that scenario 🤣🤣Opening the episode with a reverse 180º in a 30 year old Merc TD wagon... Man is living his (read: my) best life.I'm really enjoying these shows. Thank you guys for entertaining me. I didn't know putting you 3 together can be so funny. 💪💪🤣🤣Best episode yet, some hilarious content  here mayneThe murcielago looks so good on a track.I was dying laughing at Ed in this episodeCops were awesome to help you guys film this vid; great stuff!"Ed, how's your car running"
Like the BMW M3 GTR in Need For Speed Most Wanted 2005.Seeing them do this in their first cars makes me want to go and buy another of my first car (my actual first car got junked), a 2004 pontiac vibe (not gt sadly)“Imagine what one point would do to his license with all those cars”

“It would destroy him” 😂😂😂Keep it up!!!! This is what I need. OG top gear done right!!!Epic series, love it😃😎👏This series is epic! Thanks for the great content, guys!!Love these Car Trek series.OMG this is the best episode so far! GJ guys keep em coming pls pls :DThis whole video had me dying of laughter🙌🏼I love the lambs headliner. That's sick. Ima look into putting one similar into my 2020 Mustang GTs roof.I do not know how I feel, so many mixed feeling, this whole series has done great for Audi lol, I feel like I want one now sht man ED!!! what had you done!!!!Hilarious. I would have liked to see a Le Mans start for the police chase though 🤣Best racing camera work up until now great episodedrone shots are esquisite!! congrats on another great episodeThis looks cool as heck!!! The legal and proper way to go about doing this. Where can I sign up?I sort of want Ed's Audi...ants and all...I'll check AutoTempest for it!Not many things in life feel as good as - successfully running away from cops. Always wanted to do it and I did it couple of years ago. It was a blastthat mercedes getting passed by that beater maxima and then crashing into the back of it when they parked had me in tears laughing.
I remember "racing" in my beater cars getting beat like that, too funny.On the bright side, the next time Ed gets in a car with Tyler behind the wheel, he'll remember to down a bottle of sea sickness pills first!Ed turns into a different person when he drivesI like Ed, my favorite through Car Trek. Janky cars, an ungodly amount of one liners, and typically watches Ty and Fred butt heads lolI had a black B5 S4 as my first car. Had a few instances like this. It’s a very capable car.You three definitely should be the new Top Gear USA cast!!!Tyler's face while taxi-driving the rest of the crew around the track at the beginning was hysterical.You guys deserve a prime time slot on television.literally everyone had that “bread and butter run through my veins” phasewhen the "phase" is not just a phase 🍞🧈I love how she perfectly mimicks child conversations"it's a combination of meats and cheeses" *pours grapes*

What meat is that?Bread and butter is so good.I don’t know how she does it, but this teacher has the VERY magical ability to totally transform herself into an elementary school student, and it’s so spot-on. She’s soooo absolutely adorable. And I KNOW she had to be the cutest, little girl, cuz she still looks like a cute little girl lol. I’m so entertained. Just the subtle nuances and storylines. You actually fall in love with the “students” lol. I adore Sarah. 🤗💜💕💗♥️🙏🏾I use to always eat bread and butter and my mom would get so mad at me for wasting butter 😂You seem like an amazing teacher! You seem so kind hearted, and like you genuinely care about your students.Baking some bread tomorrow, I’ll go through my 78th “bread and butter” phase 😂I love this series!Congrats! Your on trending :D I love when this happens to youtubers who need to be recognized more.Lovely, all of them!I can relate to the bread and butter phase, my youngest daughter went through a bread and syrup phase, she ate breakfast, lunch and dinner! 👍🏽I’d be Charcuterie, definitely— I just love that comboYour videos make my day, thank you!! 🥺💕Story: once in grade 3, I had like a tuna lunchable-kinda thing and ended up cutting my finger from the can and was bleeding everywhere. It didn’t really hurt, but it just looked bad because of the blood. We had a sub that day who was a bit strict, and when I walked up to him he was talking with another student. I tried to interrupt him to tell him, and he said, “Are you on fire? Are you bleeding?” In a sarcastic tone, then said, “Then go back to your seat”, expecting me to have just wanted to ask a question that could wait. I mean, I was technically interrupting his conversation. I told him that I actually was bleeding and showed him, and he freaked right out lol. He took me to the bathroom and helped and showed me how to rinse it off with cold water and then apply pressure to stop it from bleeding before adding a band aid. He made sure to listen to everyone for the rest of the day and for any other time he subbed for my class lolI just found this page and I am hook! She is awesome and the fact that we can all relate is just insane lmfao .But those fruit cups are SO HARD TO OPEN, I have to really try not to spill one every time I have one!I had this phase over summer break. My grandma sacrificed a lot of bread and butter for me 😂If I had a teacher like her when I was going through 4 years of bullying I don't think I wouldve dropped out in high-school.I literally feel her every character is different (In a good way) 
Her shorts are so good that I imagine all her characters sitting in a room and acting like how children normally act.the pain I feel whenever those fruit cups spill is unreal 🥲I literally love you, you're so adorableOkay, I’ve gotta say. And I hope this doesn’t come off weird, but you’d be a WONDERFUL VO Artist for a young girl. You sound sooo convincing me or hour sounding like you’re trying. Amazing honestly.Love your videos, keep going, sending good vibes 😎The growth on this video is nuts. Nice one!“bread and butter is just so good”
me: girl i feel you😂Bro i literally brought butter sandwiches to school for like a month in elementry, ngl i was never happier- bread+butter=pure joyI love how in your videos you play the kids’ roles really well that you can obviously tell that its you but it feels like its a different character than yourself, its really cool! Its funny seeing all the personalities that you act out!I'm having a strong relationship with bread and butter toasted with sugar phase for yearsOh my god the last time I've checked you sub count it was at 12K and now 100K+?? Incredible. Keep up the good work.Your so fun !!!! I love you ❤️ thank you 😊 for sharingI swear English teachers have the most satisfying voice
(Might just be me and she might not be a English teacher)I think I'm going through the bread and butter phase right now....or last week it was ruined the moment I found THE THICKEST BLACK HAIR IN MY BREAD...It still haunts meI love this series! But, as a brazilian, I think is very weird that the among of food the american teenagers eat for lunch is equal my school snack😅please continue posting, it's sooo entertaining, i watched all your videosYou’re so close to 1 mil❤️Any one else had a commando style lunch lady at elementary who would scream into a megaphone to signal lunch was over like she was talking to her fresh recruits fresh off the bus XDBro the fact I’m actually obsessed with bread and butter but I just OBLITERATE it with cinnamon sugar 😂I love these videos, keep it up!She is so adorable with these!!I'm going through the bread and butter phase rn-This series is my favorite thing on YT shorts right now.

This is by far the best series on YouTube!“the asian”
“what do you have for lunch?”
*“I have rice and hotdogs.”*“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” - John 3:16A combination I like to do is spread butter on the bread and then add sugar it tastes pretty goodThese shorts are so addicting 😂Lol I'm going through that "bread and butter" phase currently😂i cant stop watching theseeeeee there so gooddddThis was so me, i went through all of these phasesI went through that bread and butter phase too 😭Literally everyone had that “bread and butter run through my veins” phaseI love when all the “kids” are talking to each other hahahThis is adorable. Made me subscribeI also have to bring in a lunch everyday, and as a person with seven siblings, it’s a sandwich, some kind is fruit, and a treat. 😂These school lunch shorts are so cute! And so true 😁I’m obssessed with this seriesWow 😳 she's literally old but looking soo energetic and young 😊😯 keep it upI have the same lunchbox that you use in your videos and I can confirm that thing will live forever. I am in college, have had it since 8th grade 😳😂Your channel is amazing and you keep growing everyday!In India, it's always 5star meals during lunch times. Rice, three kinds of curry, fried vegetable, pickes, dessert. Fun times🤣I went through this phase where I ate a lot of bread and butter heated up in the microwave, it’s so good y’all need to try itIdk, but the “butter bread” phase has lasted at least 5 years for meI was the “unique leftovers” kid.

The reason everyone in my class gets sick every 8months and I get sick every
2-3 years"it's a combination of meats and cheeses" pours grapes

What meat is thatMy mom never let me have a Lunchable for lunch because she said cheese and crackers were a snack, not a meal. 
So now I tease her when I make charcuterie boards and she eats to the point of spoiling her dinner. I tell her cheese and crackers are not a meal 🤣🤣🤣Ngl ever since i started teaching myself how to bake bread I've been on a bread and butter kick too. Throw some homemade preserves in the mix and you're cooking with gasI just found you some days ago and i am so addicted! love your videos and this is my fav series! 😍 keep making more! Love you and stay safe 💕I discovered you yesterday and in subbing I love your skits :DBro that is so relatable with opening the lid for the mango slices or orange slices inside and all the juice spills.

My milk bottle was a penguin 🐧 that I named Quinn. I had cereal and milk for breakfast, lunch, snack, dessert, and again would try to sneak another bowl 🥣I wish you we're my teacher when i was in 3rd grade 😭💀In Kindergarten (kindergarten was the last time I went to school; I’m homeschooled now) my lunch was always a peanut butter and honey sandwich (I didn’t eat jam because it had seeds and we didn’t have jelly. Still don’t really eat jam or jelly but now it’s because it’s too sugary), grapes, an apple or a banana, water and sometimes goldfish crackers or if I was really lucky my mom would make gingerbread, lemon bread or brownies. Whenever I got dessert in my lunch I’d feel so superior to the kids who got Oreos everyday… idk why tho lolMs.Pam looks like my teacher just a little connection.You are my favorite teacher 💕❤and you are so sweet and very thoughtfulMrs Pam When did you get 175k!!!?!?!?! I remember when you were at 1kImagine having her as your teacherits not just a phase mom 😭Yeah I’m the classic lunch.. sandwich, chips and an apple every single day.. I love itI always eat toast and butter together for breakfast i feel the exact same way as ur first actI just discoverd your channel!!! I love this!! 🤣🤣🤣I adore these!Hello Pam I found your videos 2 days ago and I loooooove them!I love watching these series so entertaining🌼🍄I jus sat here & watched every single 1 of your vids 😁😅 Mahalo all the way from Maui Hawai'i 🍍Meanwhile: *me eating a jacket potato with cheese and  yoghurt for lunch on my red tray and with my red cup*You remind me so much of my 5th grade teacher Ms Hansen in Murray, UTmy type of lunch: MCDONALDSAll i have is the good old sandwich, crisps and juice😋😌My sister is going through the ‘massive phase’i love these!that first girl aint wrong. had bread and butter at a fancy restaurant, my dude hit different then i tried at home and… sadThis series is my favorite thing on YT shorts right now.  You have your kid impressions spot on!😆 What grade(s) are you portraying?  I feel like this is 3rd grade, but I could be wrong."Prop up the legs for better airflow" I feel like that can be applied to a lot of things. lolMy guy changed the turkey's skin color 3 times without consent 😭😭😭💀This sounds perfect"And just like that the turkey was black" ⚫ got my flying broWhat I do at the bar on a Saturday night.

"Prop up the legs for better airflow"At this rate he’s gonna dry age himselfThe turkey was all of the colors of Christmas. Red, Green, and Black for the despair after new year.Evil Max be like:
Boiled under pair stone high and fastmans gonna have the best thanksgiving this year 🍾The turkey be looking like the armoured Titan when it was dry agedSo glad that the iconic line is back.
*"Applewood low and slow"*Im going to miss this guy❤I think people should season under the skin as well. Putting all the seasoning on the skin alone does nothing to the flesh so when the skin comes off you just have plain unflavored turkey."Apple Wood, low and slow" instantly made my day betterHappy Thanksgiving everyoneDamn, want some of that!!! 🥺We’re smoking over applewood high and fastI'd really consider myself lucky if I got to taste ur food😍I just love when he said " Low and Slow"... I just love Max"s video. His love for meat is obvious and his recipes are amazing..I bet Gordon Ramsay will cry after seeing this againOkay this dude can cook and also what an insanely unique combination of seasonings and curry rub for turkeyThink you could do anything with venison? It's deer season here in Wisconsin, and I'm wondering of some special ways I can make venison. If you already did a video and someone could put a link in the replies to have a deal that would be great too.‘Apple wood low and slow’ is the best lineWhat’s your go to seasoning?"Nice spicy thai curry paste"

As a Thai, *IM TERRIFIED*dr suess applauds from the grave.Uncle roger be crying at that ‘thai curry’ tho"And just like that...the turkey was black."“the turkey was green” that had me laughing so hard i think my humor is brokenI thought the beginning was some kinda freaky deaky Thanksgiving OnlyFans ad 💀😭🤣Contentment is an indispensable treasure  .I've added this to my draw dropping list"it was juicy"
*barely any juice comes out*Dr. Kleiner: "I wonder where Lamar went."Max..Turkey look a lil strange..proceeds to make a bomb ass turkey 😋

Me..turkey looks a lil strange..throws it out and orders pizza

That's the difference between a "boss" (Max) and an "employee" (me) 😩😂😆😝Looks good. The tossing of green onions is hilarious!Hate how people are dry aging everything. There's a reason you've never heard of a dry aged turkey. Lol😋 looks deliciousI swear to god if this man made a medium rare chicken im losing my mind“Prop up the legs for better air flow”

Me when I fartThat's an interesting concept 😊My gut that looks sooo delicious i wish i could try thatNicely done, Max. 👍👍Uncle Roger would be mad you used a food processor 💀 hAiYyAOmg that’s looks amazingly yummy@Max the Meat Guy cancel the spambots if possibleM A D respect bro. That shit looks GOODThis is how the “Green eggs and ham” startedOh man!!!!! I love thai flavors and Turkey = AWESOME!!!!“But had a nice dry exterior”

It was spit roasted and was incredible.
So was the CrocodileIf only I had a nickel for every time Max said “Low and slow”Good lord.  Your shit always looks bombI can heart Gordon Ramsey yell: ¡¡IT IS BURNED!! But to me, It looks delicious.as thai,i'm so satisfying that max made a thai curry pasteHe didn't knew but indirectly made an Indian dipping sauxce *chutney* (that green paste)  but it is slightly thinner 😉That Juice! I've never seen a turkey as juicy as a phat brisket.I love this dudeWow! Amazing 😀
Delicious 👍Thing looked ready to fight god when you  brought it out of the dry age cabinet thingy.I don't really like turkey. However, this one you made. I would love to try some.Delicious!These videos are always quality and funny"cover the entire bird.. the turkey is green"The turkey after dry age lookin like a Colossal Titan😂😂That bird finna make me act up😩Just like that the chicken was back 😂Nothing beats a fried turkey for being juicy.Damnn brk whenever i see this, this alway makes me hungryGreat job 👏 from chef adamI mean... He is so damn prettyIn an alternate universe, his catchphrase is “ were smoking over hickory high and fast “Man cooked a part of the colossal titan“Prop up the legs for better airflow” i see matt has jokes now lolThat looks so good 😊 😱👌🏽❤️😩💯That’s rawIt's been a while since I hear he say " apple wood, low and slow "I've never had turkey that wasn't super dry.Him: cuts the turkey to slices

That had me laughing for too longIt was red goes with a lot of things 😉Hickory: High and fast.Contentment is an indispensable treasure 🌹🙂 .Today for Thanksgiving were having green turkeySo nobody’s gonna talk about the red turkey looking like a freaking colossal titanI like how he bites the leg when he sliced many piecesTastyI feel bad for the neighbors. Having to smell that good stuff and not eat any.When I die can I be dry aged?Can you dry age fish?It kinda looked like fresh cut grass was on the turkey but it looked good lol“Jerk seasoning? CAN D- oh you meant that”Dry age chicken?The turkey looks like it’s buff😂😋Tbh you should've used pestle and mortar for thai green curryI show my dog your chicken and he was drooling.Holy shit it can have juiceHow he thought why the turk is black: Due to the sugars and the coconut milk.

My mind: Carbon soot bro! Carbon!!

(I'm salivating on this now)🙃Should put the paste under the skin next time 👍I know how much you love making expensive food buy I have a question.

*Maybe Canadians are worse?*

Americans:
*If we stay quiet for long enough maybe he won’t notice us*Hey, I’m the creator of one of these videos, and I just wanted to let you know that - despite being totally blind - I’m aware of my surroundings and I could tell where things were because I put them in their places myself. Generally, when I put things down, I have to remember where I put them - otherwise, my life would be ridiculously difficult! As humans, we adapt and overcome when we lose our sight or become disabled in a different way. You’d do it too if you were in my position!WillNE: "Why are you shouting"

Also WillNE: "RIGHT HELLO"They said break a leg since in medieval ages when they would wish you on success on your act in a theater, they meant that they hoped a lot of people came to watch. People would use horses so when there was a lot of horses, there was also a lot of horse poop, which people would slip on and break their legs. So it basically meant good luck on getting an audience.“You’re telling us good things but I don’t like you.” LmaoBreak a leg actually refers to going on the stage. The curtains on the side of the stage are called legs and when you walk out onto the stage you “break” the illusion of the leg. Casts used to be much larger than they are now with multiple people playing the same part so “break a leg” was saying “hope you go on stage”That break a leg tik tok was total nonsense. Everything she said she probably made up.WillNE: " Why are we shouting?"
Also WillNe: " RIGHT 'ELLO!"It hurts me that people are gonna believe everything the ‘today years old’ girl saidAs a Canadian living in Alberta, I can confidently say I have never in my life seen bagged milk.Most western Canadians actually do use regular liquid milk. As a western Canadian, I think it’s kinda weird to drink powdered milk, but some of my family members use it because it’s very preservable.8:07 i can confirm that isn’t the case, tv show pilots are called pilots because it’s like a pilot study (an initial test of an experiment to see if it needs any additional changes) it’s a test to see if the show works :]“Would love to be this unemployed” as he proceeds to watch a video of the guy licking the ball 😂*"if you're blind how do you know what you're pointing at?"*

My laugh turned into a coughing fit I stgGotta give it to willne, earning big bucks for half hearted videos of ripping other people's content and talking a bit for years, yet we still watch them 🤷‍♂️😂 fair play bill, fair play 👏👏👏👌"ah my phones out of charge" less than minimum effort goes into these lmaoUs blind folk still know where our stuff is, especially if we're home, hence we can point at it. I don't have a braillenote but a lot of tech can read things to us, amongst other handy things, so I'm guessing one use of the camera could be that she could take a photo of a document etc and have it made accessible.Everything that girl said in the "I was today years old" tiktok was wrong lol.There is not an official origin for "break a leg." But the one I'm most familiar with refers to making it past the 'leg' curtain, onto the stage.As a Canadian, I have never met a single person that uses milk in a bagOoo think Will’s back to being consistent

Won’t bet on that tho#1 on trending Good job Will you deserve it!Milk bags are far more common and popular in Ontario and Quebec. In the western provinces we have regular cartons and jugs.

Also "break a leg" is said before an audition or production, not because of them "ending up in a cast" but due to superstition rooted in the past of acting. Saying "good luck" or similar positive phrases are thought to jinx a personAs a Canadian I have never owned or even seen milk in a bag. It's only something that's common in the Eastern part of the country, not all of it!Nice to see a new video *literally* for once, good to see you Will!As a Canadian I can say that there are places that have milk in a bag. Where I live does not have bags but they are real.I was told by my dance teacher that "break a leg" is the opening of a stage curtain. Also the phrase "in the lime light" comes from old stage lighting before electricity.Will: maybe i should hear you out
also will: pauses tiktok to reenact him punching the sharkThis video is equal parts excited and learning things and being angry and hating everything and I love it so much.Breaking a leg is actually not only because they hope you get in a cast there are several other reasons too.
Like before an audition they would say break a leg to wish bad luck because wishing good luck would 'jinx' it.
The saying also comes from some theatres instead of clapping at the end they would bang the chairs wishing that the leg of the chair would be if it was good enough.
It doesn't stop there the long curtains on the sides of the stage are called legs and you have to 'break a leg' (walk between the curtains) to get on stage.Wills done a cracking job with that thumbnail only a click bait god can create a master piece like that 😂Will getting triggered is the best thing. We need a compilationnot canadian but minnesotan and i grew up with bags of milk :) we just folded the corner and put a clip on it when we were done. i can’t tell you how many times i cut the bag too far and it flopped over and spilled the milk :’))))The first of a TV show is not called a pilot because it's the first on air.
It's called a pilot in the same way a pilot hole of a drill is, because pilot can mean multiple things.Oh and fun fact:
I used to work at Costa coffee and they use milk in bags because you can fit a lot more of them in the fridges!I’m surprised there’s anything to learn on tiktok at all.Will: “Basically a bunch of tik toks that are supposed to teach you something but they will probably, definitely be horrendous”

Me: 🙋‍♀️🤦‍♀️We did the milk bags in the U.K. too, mainly Sainsburys. At that point it was better for the environment than the standard bottlesDown your drink every time Will says, ‘howdidhedothat!’"You're telling us good things, but I don't like you." This is why I subscribe.As a canadian the milk in bags is mostly prolly in ontario or in other weird provinces, most provinces and territories use cartons onlyHey Will, South Africans also use milk bags. It tends to be cheaper, so it is quite popularI always forget how angry a northerner Will is lolWill you've got to be my favourite YouTuber I hope you read this and have a good dayA pilot is actually called a pilot because the whole point of them is to try and get a show on air, not because its on the air 😂
For those who don't know, Pilots are made as a test for a show or a consept to then either show to a test audience so a company can evaluate if it should be broadcasted, or made by a group  to try and pitch it to a company like Netflix or fox,Loving the daily uploads Will!This is top tier to watch when stoned 😂⚡️I like how he's just annoyed with most of themJust so y’all know not all Canadians have milk in a bag it’s just the eastern part of Canada in Ontario and Quebec, every where else it comes in a normal 4L carton lolI think it’s time to say that this is a reaction channel…It took me the exact length of this video to eat my tea,now that’s an interesting factWill : Why are we shouting always?
Also will : RIGHT HELLOOOOOOOO?!?!?!?That's why Milk from all the Among Us vids is called MilkInABag, makes so much sense now (he's Canadian)I'm Canadian and i've never had milk out of a bag, or have i heard of anyone in my city doing it lol... and quite frankly, its disturbing.8:07 well actually (i know this will make people hate me but still),  'Pilot' comes from the Greek 'pedon' (steering oar) and connoted a person who steered the ship. From there it took on the definition as anyone who leads the way on a journey, like the pilot in a plane.I’m a Canadian and I have never met a Canadian who buys milk in a bag, nor have I ever seen them in stores… must be a prairie or eastern Canadian thingPeople don’t need to loose 100% vision to be legally blind, and it can also manifest differently depending on what is causing the blindness. I knew someone who had a very narrow spot near the center of his eye with relatively normal vision, but the other 90% was completely blurred, and the other eye was 100% blurred, but obviously with that small bit of clear vision he could still do some stuff, like read a text message on his phone, but obviously vision impaired severely and thus legally blind.That my friend, is not an alligator. It's a saltwater crocodile in the Katherine river in Australia. They run a cruise ship where they dangle bits of meat out on a string and he crocs jump up to get it. It's pretty cool to watch.#1 on trending will, well done''ok you're telling us good things but I don't like you''  This what I thought in my head every time my Maths teacher spoke."you're telling us good things but I don't like you" 😂😂That last one about the long nails, I’ve always thought about how a minor hit would just tear your nail off. Ouch."He tried to scran the chilli and the chilli fucked it" 😂😂Will I love how u get annoyed at the same things I get annoyed atLove you man and hope you will reach 3mil
Love from Tunisia 🇹🇳The milk in the bag thing only really happens in Ontario, every other part of Canada I’ve been to doesn’t do itThe last woman with the long nails is my favourite person ever on tiktok! Honestly she’s amazingI pre-ordered a PS2 back in 2000, I figured out the rotating symbol fairly straight away.Milk in bags was a thing in the UK about 7 years ago. Shop I work at stopped doing it because they broke all the time‘They probably yeet them around in there’ 😂😂😂Will I must say that in Canada it's mainly central and eastern Canada that use bags. We of the west coast use jugs like normal people.sand is called sand bc it originates from the latin word "zand" meaning "fine dust"Lol in my country, which is South Africa, we have milk in bags as well, but we do have options of it in bottles as well, but it's more expensive6:37 the fastest record for the mega bruiser is 17 days, 4hours, 8 minutes and 19 seconds. The dude probably spent 2 ½ to 3 weeks at least livking it 7013 timesHow did the blind person know where to position the camera in order to record that TikTok. At multiple points the camera adjusts so you can see the screen better but how would she know to adjust itAs someone from Ontario, Canada - I’ve almost exclusively had milk from a bag, my entire life. I’m 30.In argentina we have milk in bags too, but they aren’t transparent. We call it a sachet of milkEvery day I hope will announces a new YM dropGlad you learned my friend.Just to clarify, only some provinces in Canada drink milk in a bag. I know that Alberta and British Columbia don't.5:08 wait till he figures out what a tiger's tongue looks likeas a canadian.....milk just tastes better from a bag 😭Brake a leg is good luck for an actor (mostly stage preforming) because it helps keep the past spirits from messing up the show! Of you are to tell an actor good luck spirits see that as a time to come out, that actor then has to do a ritual for as many times as they say "good luck"  -a theatre kidI just noticed that wills face in his thumbnails rarely changeWill, how'd you hit #1 on trending with this?8:25 love it. Says what everyone is thinking7:15 as a Canadian, I've never seen bagged milkive been having to rewatch older videos thank you for uploading ive been so bored7:33 Can't believe Will just called out Smii7y like thatWill: tiktoks that taught me smth
Parents: impossibleI actually had a teacher who got attacked by a shark and punched it in the face and that did stun it enough that he could swim back to his boat. He had to get 30 stitches for his bite but he lived!"right hello" always makes my dayThe venus fly trap didn't die because of the chilli. If they can't create a water tight seal around the meal, it's digestive juices leak out and that head dies. It would have died from a fly on a stick.“Break a leg” is for a performance of a play as saying “good luck” often causes disasters.Me having known the car handles thing because I was a bored curious child lolThe attitude on this video lol I’m loving itThe muscle memory and cat tongue tiktoks were genuinely horrific that shit is disgusting4:00 There's actually debate over whether this experiment actually proves that bees perceive time. There are 2 theories on why the bees did this, one being that they perceive time, the other being that they just learned to exit their hives at the same time out of habit and conditioning (similar to the experiment where the scientist taught a dog to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding it every time they rang a bell.) This experiment proves only that a bee can develop habit, not whether they can perceive time (frankly, there's no way to conclusively prove this kind of thing unless a bee were to tell someone that they can perceive time.I like how will is wrong a lot and doesn't understand most things to he tries to make cynical comedy and ends up sounding thickWill : I just want to punch the dentist in the noseThat fake shocked face does my head in. It fills me with irrational rage.Was waiting for Will to realize that's why MilkInABag from Sidemen Among Us is called that :(The break a leg thing so you get in a cast ain't true. There are several reasons it's called breaking a leg. one reason is cause in theatre it's bad luck to wish someone good luck as it jinxs it, so you wish them bad luck so they get good luck. Another reason is cause the area an actor leaves past the curtain is sometimes called a leg, so if you break a leg you go out on stage and no just behind the scenes. I've heard of several reasons as why we say break a leg in theatre but the cast one is just a pun.Bagged milk isn't near as much big a thing as some Canadians make it out to be, in all my 23 years I haven't seen a single person actually have bagged milk in their fridge0:52 Take into account the average sizes of those things and that iceberg was like medium in size and probably smaller lol.7:42  will: "Why are you shouting"

Also will: 0:00As a Canadian I can say that bagged milk isn't everywhere, here in barren Saskatchewan there is no such thing as bagged milkas a canadian i do NOT drink bagged milkThe first of a TV show is not called a pilot because it's the first on air. It's called a pilot in the same way a pilot hole of a drill is, because pilot can mean multiple things.At 8:00 this is incorrect, break a leg actually comes from when the curtain was pulled up and down by a “leg” and this would break if it was used too much, so if you got enough encores (meaning the show was good) you would “break a leg”The blue dye is actually made for lakes! Its very safe for the wild life and some are made with nutrients that helps grow the plant life !! Also bagged milk is superiorLowkey kinda stupid that Will thought it was cool to see what happened to the Venus fly trap that was given a pepper, but testing if bees can actually perceive time in hours is a waste of time. So many of these are fascinating and they just fly right over his head lololI absolutely flipped the PS sign. Can’t believe you didn’t know.As someone who is obsessed with bees…it’s me. I care.I cared about the bees perceiving time, and I am not ashamed.Tonights reason for not falling asleep right away; picturing jetlagged bees. I'm not complaining though.YOURE TRENDING WILL LETS GOthe reason the venus fly trap died wasn't cus the chilli was spicy or anything, its cus they use all their energy closing, if they close on something they cant digest (ie not a fly) they cant get the energy back to re-open and close on a new fly.and here’s things I learned from willWhat a beautiful man supplyin us with vidsWill have you not played Among Us with Milk… as in “MilkInABag” 😂7:39 Will, I'd like to tell you that bagged milk is only in eastern Canada. Us westerners have our milk in jugs and cartons like the rest of the world.As a McDonalds employee, our registers do not take photos of peoples cars, we just know which one you are because it's a queueWell done for no 1 on trending mate !Why Canadians have milk in bags ->
"Plastic milk bladders adapted more easily to the new metric standards and thus gained an edge in some parts of the Canadian market (1967)"

I live and grew up in Western Canada and I've never seen bagged milk in stores. In Western Canada
 bagged milk kinda ran its course around early 90's, i think. We now use just regular cartons for milk. 

Eastern Canada however still uses bagged milk regularly.The break a leg one is wrong too, break a leg is in reference to the legs used to hold curtains at a stage. They say break a leg in hopes that you get so many cheers they reopen the curtain for an encore multiple timesI love Willne.I’m guessing how to make financial decisions is one thing you learned because you make some questionable ones will.Another day with a “Right Hello” and my days already better"Break a leg" actually comes from stagehands having to quickly drop a curtain when an applause at the end of a show goes on for too long.Another day with a “Right
 Hello” and my days already better0:40 i found this in my moms car like 7 years ago idk how and i always played with it and then i broke it lmaoThe handle thing in cars is to hang your clothes, you put hangers on there for clothes you don't want wrinkledSainsbury’s tried to sell milk in bags a while ago, anyone else remember?I can confirm, those mirrors are squishy#1 on trending go on willIt's sad how the guy licking the jaw breaker still puts more effort in than will has recentlyMy mom would get bagged milk and I would accidentally cut the hole too big on it lmaoWell done willThe venus fly trap was just killed bruh, it doesn't matter the food or item, if it stays too long in a venus fly trap, the very thing it uses to make the item evaporate will destroy the plant itself. VERY SAD0:44 if you want curtains up to block out the sun or privacy, you can use thatAs a Canadian i have never seen bagged milkI've seen milk in a bag here in England, it's weird and no one seems to buy themThe blue die actually helps fish because if makes sure algae doesnt grow to much and create bacteria that can harm fishAs a canadian I have never seen bagged milk, it's all in jugsWillNE: "Why are you shouting" 100%!I told you this series won’t dieSand isn't called sand because it's between the sea and land.This is brilliantim so unbelievably angry at the “i was today years old when.” girlMaccies fries are only good for the first 60 seconds so it's absolutely useless to know how to save them8:00 literally everything she said is false lmaoCovid lives on those nails 😭The basketball is easy to win; the hoops are squished, but all it means is you have to do is not hit the rim. Look for the one that's the least squat and pick the a deflated ball. I win a giant Teddy every year at our annual fair, and I'm not amazing at basketball. Fair games are rigged but they aren't impossible.The first episodes of shows are usually called pilot because it's the first time the show airs (on air) like a plane in the air.All I have learned from this video is where MilkInABag got his name from8:02 thats not true atall its because its considered bad luck to wish someone luck in a theter so you tell them to break a leg to not jinx the preformence9:39 his first thought was 'how do you scratch your arse' bruhActually  Canadians store their milk in bags because it’s cheaper to make and better for the environmentthe break a leg one is false as the leg is the thing that pulls the stages curtains and if people kept on wanting an encore or people wanted you to bow again because it was so good  they would have to keep closing and opening the curtains therefore making people use the leg a lot and possibly break it so its not saying "get into the cast" its saying "have an amazing performance"The nail lady had attitute because nobody believes her she can wash her hands xDNot all Canadians use bagged milk! Its only an Ontario thing as far as I’ve seenCant believe this is number 1 trending at this point in timeSpread the gospel turn to God,AmenTo the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message 

Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ? 

the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all
Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved 

Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity 

 God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins 

God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved 

the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins 

receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today 

John 3 
For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. 

This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned

. But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].””
‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭

For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.”
‭‭Romans 6.23

2 Peter3

 9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins"Who made that their life's work" said the youtuber who does shit to entertain people. They were curious and liked bees so they found the answer to the question they asked. And it probably helps a lot with creating tech for bees and possibly other pollinators. And beekeepers. And zoologists.Old English sand, from Proto-Germanic *sandam (source also of Old Norse sandr, Old Frisian sond, Middle Dutch sant, Dutch zand, German Sand), from PIE *bhs-amadho- (source also of Greek psammos "sand;" Latin sabulum "coarse sand," source of Italian sabbia, French sable), suffixed form of root *bhes- "to rub."


From Rtymology online, meaning sand doesnt come from sea and land, it comes from a variety of older languages which seem to come from the root of "to rub" basically, sand is rough, corase, irritating and it gets everywhereSurely you do a will and James watch the inbetweeners. It would be good as.I live in Canada and milk in bags is not popular lmao. They're making it seem like it's popular all over Canada'how does she know what she's pointing at if she's blind'

Good vibes and infectious attitude.He's a lads lad, lad.He's very likeable. A win's a win. I slightly fear that he might a bit too easy to hit and this might cause him a few embarrassments if his team aren't able to do something about it...Congrats Paddy ! Stay humble and graft hard. This is the future.How can you hate on this guy. Just look at him. 😂 Love it.He’s here to fight, watch him go far he’s got the heart and the mentality GO ON LAD🐐Big fan, this lad is the people’s champ, for every normal lad. He’s a great advert for everyone, you should always back yourself. You’ll definitely get there Paddy lad because you believe you will!I really like  this guy. I live in Las Vegas and we all were impressed with this dude. Paddy, just remember there's no scrubs in the UFC, keep you hands up and you're going to get paid.You cannot hate this man, what a cut.I understood 50% of what he said but it will be interesting to see how his career goes in the UFC. I think he will do well.Pimblett, not only understands the fight aspect of MMA, he also gets the business, promotional side of the business, betting when his fighting career over, he'll still be in the MMA Business in some form. Really enjoy his fighting style, like him, himself from interviews i've watched...hoping kid has a great UFC career"Take me hat off to Luigi man, he can take a punch and a kickgggg!"....you're a legend Paddy!Paddy the Baddy ... Born To Brawl 🙏This guy takes the cake! I like him a lot. Keep going Paddy!Paddy making half the world wanna be scousers and its triggering the whole of England 😂I love this guy man.. lol pure confidence and savagery. True tuffguy. Salute bro.Paddy the baddy, nice  personality , very likable and a big hunger to rise to the top, cant wait to see him next time!

Well done kid !I love this kid. Number #1 in personality, and very talented in the ring.Props to him for realising he needs to take less shots, hes got a lot of respect to earn from fighters and fans in regards to his UFC career but hopeful and excited for his future fights and progression.''I was travelling for 29 hours on Tuesday'' - Paddy the Baddy, 2021How can you not like the lad  he talks the talk and walks the walk ...Exciting to watch,he seems like a loveable lad and he’s a showman loves a good old scrapThis guy showed great resilience and strength some great stuff to come far from finished👍👍I love Liverpool, the place where my daughter was born, the place where I met some really amazing people. Good luck Paddy, you have a good personality, I wish you luck in your UFC career!!!Not a big fan (yet) but like Conner everything he said is so far True! You can't call it arrogance or braggadocios when you back it up in combat! Well done young man!Paddy's so funny😂😂 great win congratulations, time to take overThis guy's pure gold...We interviewed him on the channel fight week and he promised this. 

He delivered. Lightning in a bottle.He drops more lads, than jabs on a pad. Fab!!His exuberance is refreshing, and his face hardly ever looks like he took a beatingHe's not even in the top 15 yet, let's see how he develops - I really hope the sport doesn't destroy his personalityWill, Simon and Neil are so proudHopefully they wont push him too soon like they did Darren....and give him time to properly develop into a well rounded fighter. If things go right,  him and Sean are the next cash cows for the UFCHuge fan. He is up there with Giga and Usman and Khabib in my opinion as greatest in the world at the momentLove him,he’s so infectious xFair play he's come a long way since the InbetweenersSeems like a nice fella. Good luck to him.How can you not help but love this dudeTbh i watched this slowed down and paddy looked a lot more in control then what the announcers were going on about. He did take a couple shots but his technical stand up seemed on point!he'll be big in no timeHes the new kid on the block kid!!! His words 🙏🏻🤟🏼Okay. I like this kid. Killer personality! Star stuff.WHAT A LEGEND IN THE MAKING👍😝Mahahahaha Paddy you are the man!. I laughed all the interview... Best vibes broder!!!Came across this lad by accident, i dont watch mma but this lads a real character and in same mould as Fury. A peoples champ. Mc Gregor 2.

Big future for this lad. Humble scouser flying the flag 👌🏽😎He’s got more charm than when Mcgregor first came on the scene can’t wait for his next fightUfc is lucky to have you Paddy! What a kid! Dena better invest in you Paddy! I love this kid 👏💪✊gooooo! 😎This lads starting to show up everywhere. He looks promising go on Paddy ladLove this guy 👏💪Boss to see a scouser not toning anything down for the cameras for once, showing ppl how we speak and how we are without caring if people can understand us, other scousers need to take notesI like this guy!  Gonna go far.We need subtitles for this lad! Can't wait to watch and see how he does.This guy is going to be big mark my wordsI’m an American…and that Liverpool (Scouse) accent is amazing!  I love the way he pronounces words suck as “like.”Just needs to avoid more of these big blows and he could be a legend.Need characters like this. I love it. Not a huge fan but I'm getting there 😂
Defo needs some of this in mma.
Wither u want to see him knocked out or win then either way u will be buying tickets.
He is fighter and I love that.
Puts me in mind of bisping not so much the way he acts but his mind set and he is just a born to do this and he will have losses I have no doubt but he is the kind of guy that will thrive and come back stronger.
Be intriguing to see what unfolds over the coming monthsGod I love this kid!A STAR IS BORN!  refreshing to listen to.YouTube subtitles don't translate for gibberish.   Seriously though, love this guy.  I can't wait to see him fight more.  He's a complete threat.I like this guy! He seems like a good person.Good effort sky 🙏💪💪Love this kid!Hyped for this guyHe’s class this kid 🧒 I hope he makes it big because I know were he’s from and he has come from a tuff place . I hope when he makes it he becomes humble not like big mouth Conner .I was never a fan of British accent but dude this guy has a fine accent 😂. Lookh, kickh, hookh 😂Paddy is a great funny guy.Love it this lad is one to watch took some brutal hits and destroyed him wowThis guy is pretty good. Looks pretty prone to an easy knockout though.Been excited to see this kid debut, he may be the new conorEven he lose,you just cant hate this guyall about respect, respect makes a fighter.What a manWhat a guy! One to watch 😍Great win for Paddy and he's a breath of fresh of air but needs to learn to keep his chin downWhat a ladHe’s the Ron Weasley of the UFC lol, tough kid thoughActual geezer, yes paddySky are finally catching up on how big MMA is just about 7 or 8 years to late ladsUFC debut.









*Completed it mate*Thank god we have a new face in the sport everyone can get exited about.He's got the black belt. And a jaw. Plus those seriously powerful thighs! Just getting started seems like. Great fight!Proud to be a Scousercan't understand a half of what is he saying, but the kid is indeed good fighterLove it, can’t understand him at all but still love itI don’t know if like more to watch him fighting or to listen to his accent 🤣Legend lad‘Nice one the firm’ 

From someone with mates from Liverpool. I don’t think you can get any more scouse than this fellaaaaAs a non english native speaker, his pronunciation of the k, makes him really hard to understand, apart from that he seems like a really nice guy!First fight you was very close to going to sleep. You was rockedit's impossible not to like this guyLove this kid, he's the real deal, but please get your hands up.He’s a good lad, lad.What a guy💖💖😁I love this kidPaddy a top lid ✊I got your back PADDY... Let em know what your capable of, and deliver Everytime.Hes honest about the himself which is goodhe's got vision, I can respect that at leastLmfao I love this guy 😂Let's go, Paddy is taking the UFC by storm. Have a word fam where you at?Good luck, Paddy. I think your fan base is bigger than you know. Keep those gloves up.If I hadnt been watching Redmen TV & Liverpool for almost 6 years now, I wouldnt understand himProps to the lad....ladWhat a likeable characterWell done LadPaddy should start working with Gaethje and Trevor Whitman. He could learn a lot from them.I can’t explain it but I really like this lad.I like this guy already😂🔥Never expected a UFC fighter would show me how middle age English sounded likeJay's a savage 🤣I both understand what he's saying and feel like he's speaking a different languageHe's good no doubt but can he become champion?  I'm leaning towards no but could surprise.  Needs to grow in defense, needs to control his emotions in the ring, needs to grow a lot in general.  If he can weather 2 loses in a row and come back ya.. he can make it because I don't see Anderson Sylva dominance here.Future for champ respect from Dublin matego on paddy .On his next knockout, I wanna hear him say, "Dana! Dana! 60 Gs baby!" in his scouser accent lmaoThat's my brother from another mother, wee bit a ways across the sea. Yup that's me. Such a beast. What an entertainer. "I'm not a bitchass" LMFAO you're my boy BLUE!!!!!Hes not taking fights from fighters in the tp 10 until the money is right  so obviously he does say no to a fight, but for good reasonsNick Kyrgios of UFC, defo excited for himGood to see an interview that doesn’t sound like a robot!Would love to see paddy vs ConnorMy new favorite fighterDude looks solid but he’s got some absolute dogs to fight if he wants to make it to the topHe is a proper scouser but I’m a bit disappointed he’s not wearing a Henri Lloyd jumperalthough I don't understand any single sentence he "produces", but still i like this guyLove this guy! LolI look forward to the utter confusion when the Americans hear this guy.Paddy if he fights like that with a banger his jaw will crack.Go forward with that attitude and it definitely WILL go wrong! Hope he matures and makes the necessary adjustments.He’s carrying the Cartwright name , congrats jayMy man said "He hit me with a nice hwick"Way to got Ron! Harry would be so proud!This is like the nice, relatable, Conor. With a cooler accent lets be real.Scousers built different. Watching your progress keenly mr paddy the baddy70% of people  in usa will not understand what he's talking about 😂The fans may like paddy for his style, but putting hands down and taking shots is a ridiculous idea. It will effect him when he is older, hence his boxing coaches tell him. They have seen it in boxing, he will be punchy by 45. Look at Chuck LiddellI would love to see him go up to 170 and fight Masvidal.Lad is the new bro. Way to go lad. LolPaddy should fight Ignacio Bahamondes next. That'll be a good main card fight.The last time a guy from Liverpool started saying "this is my destiny" things went badlyJay has always talked the the talk and now he’s walking the walkI have high hopes for paddy , just don't be like till , omalley or garbrandt hype for nothing2:22 Love the dude!Awesome skill dude , I like to see a match with Conor McGregor. Good fighting skills u have lad best of luck to you."I kicked him in the head like 5 times lad"Patty is dope!! Keep going broPaddy putting  that overtime In

Look after yourself paddyPaddy revealing he is crazy 2:24Ignore ALL the cheap gags; this lad is out for blood ⚔️⚔️🩸🩸 🇬🇧 🇬🇧Old school scouse accent, love it.Jay from the invetweeners is proof you can become anyone you want to be. From Tv star to film star to fighter. AmazingI like this kid he is confident cocky and humble at the same time!
Wish him the best  but i defenitly see him get run over like Conor his time sill be short even if he manage to be championI cannot see this kid and not think of Ron Weasley.Paddy the laddyBravo paddy the baddyI love his accentI have no idea what this lad is saying but good on you ladIf he sprinkles a little of ‘Jay’ from inbetweeners persona, he would Definately be the new cash cowMan this kid is bad lad I'll bet his dad is glad MMA wasn't a fad lad!He's right except about the look 🤣🤣This speech needs to be subtiteled“Nice one the firm” hahahahaHe should fight “Slippin” Randy Sandoval next or maybe even Jacob “Science fiction” Warboysif I didnt know hes a brit I d swear his a dutch talking english with strong accentWho do you think will win if he had a fight with khabib?Yanks are gonna be absolutely STRUGGLING to understand his accent
🤣🤣🤣Cant get more straight to the point than a scouserHes the new kid on the block kid!!! His words 🙏🏻🤟🏼He drops more lads, than jabs on a pad. Fab!!He has the scouse attitude. He is a great lad.This is a Netflix series for motorcycle lovers. Period.Can we all agree that Ryan from Fortnine is a freaking living legend in the motorcycle community.You're not a reviewer, you're a story teller, and that's amazing!The way the paper lands perfectly on the seat at 7:58 was either unplanned or this was take 23. Either way, the fact that Ryan seemed not to notice was the best part.The episodes about weird and extinct bikes/technologies are my favourites.

Thanks guys 🙂Rumour has it that Mazda has never actually stopped developing their rotary in their secret labs deep down underground. As a former RX8 owner, I sold before seal failure, I love the rotary and would love to have another….I live in the town where Felix Wankel had his workshop and lived while engineering the rotary engine. My mother knew him. Had a small dog apparently. He also developed a boat which could dive under waves. That's why his workshop is a few feet away from lake constance. The facility is owned by Audi today.I’m super happy for you and your bike.   Not because it’s a Dorito, as awesome as it is.   But because it’s a uncommon vintage bike in great condition.

I’ve always wanted an R60 BMWMy parents were a Hercules dealer in the late 70's.  Couldn't sell any of the 3 bikes initially sold to them by the company.  So, the oil injector model(yes there was one you didn't have to pre-mix for) went to a business partner/investor.  The 2 pre-mixers, dad road raced.  One was a sprint race bike, the other the endurance bike.  Never won anything, but never finished last.  He ran them until about 1983.What talent! You have earned my subscription, young man. Keep up the great work!Back in the '70s I had an Artic Cat snowmobile with the same Sachs rotary engine, the engine size was called a 303 though. It was a good, torquey motor, and was able to power up hills that the more powerful 440s would spin their tracks on. I always wanted to try a Hercules with that motor.

Reciprocating engines have had over 100 years of development by almost every car and motorcycle manufacturing company to get them to the high level of refinement they now enjoy. By comparison, the rotary has had  only a handful of companies even get to the point of building development mules, and only one has made a serious production engine. I've always wondered where we would be if the rotary had been invented first. Imagine trying to convince a rotary engine manufacturer that they need to replace their engine with something that had 100 times more parts and vibrated like a paint shaker.Good video.   There is no conspiracy to keep the Wankel engine down.    It's been tried and flopped many times.    They are really bad with emissions, cold weather dirve-ability, reliability....I like how Ryan doesn't ask the viewers to subscribe and like his video.  The viewers subscribe and like the video because they feel compelled to by the quality of the content and don't need to be pushed to do it.Ah yes, the ol' Rotary.
 it's like a genius kid to divorced parents, there's so much potential, but it all hides under heaves of hardships and trouble.Just came across your content, you have a new subscriber.

Interesting and entertaining at the same time, quite rare these days!I don't know how you always keep this crazy good standard. I swear your videos are better than 70% superhero movies, they are like little stories with mythology history science. Thank you man.In 1974 I was in the Army, station in What was West Germany, and I remember the Hercules rotary engine motorcycle. I was fascinated by it but I couldn’t figure out how it worked. It was a nice looking bike and I still remember this weird motorcycle like it was yesterday. Thanks for doing a show on it, it made me fill young again.Just found this channel through recommendations. Not an organ donor myself but enjoy the odd moto channel, Ichicban Moto always made me smile.  Some great content here, and looks like you are a fellow BC Boy too ! Cheers !When the Suzuk RE5 was contemporary, the Australian Motorcycle racing rules counted the capacity as twice the single-rotor-face capacity, so for the RE5, it was rated as a 1,000 cc. Bit more reasonable than counting 3/3, or 1/3.
RE5 was of limited practicality, but that didn't stop me from riding from Melbourne to Darwin and back again, one fine month, about 5,000 odd miles.
I have one sitting in the shed, waiting for me to move into a residence with a garage (or should I say: into a garage with attached residence).
Good vid, I enjoyed it.He is pretty dang awesome and his riding skills are hard to beat.Rolls Royce made the compression problems and also the efficiency problems go away by using a two stage rotary. It made enough compression to work as a Diesel generator. In essence a supercharger/turbocharger hybrid. with a big compression rotary and a small rotary that used the compressed air from the big one and spat the remains of its combustion back on to the big one too. They were geared together. 
That still doesn't solve the lubrication issue, but it does solve the problem of how to get it to bang hard enough."I visited Poland in September.  You just can't get carried away."--Ryan, as much as I howled in laughter, you are definitely going to the special hell for that one!"I once went to Poland in September, It was lovely! you just can't get carried away" lines like this are an example of great writing! some of the best out thereVaya recuerdos de la juventud… era una máquina súper !!!Missing the most important feature of the Hercules. 

At the motorcycle shop I worked at, we had a couple of Hercules advertising posters that clearly showed that if you purchased a Hercules, topless Scandinavian models would happily jump on the back of the seat.

I still have no idea why it failed. That should have been the biggest feature.I owned a 1973 Hercules Wankel 2000 in the early 1980's.  All spare parts came out of Quebec, Canada.  You had to *WRITE A LETTER* with a list of parts (including part #) you wanted.  They replied with prices for each item.  You then responded with which parts you wanted to buy and included a check.  You accepted it because it was the only way to get them!!!  I can't count the number of times people asked me if it was a jet engine!Definitely a fun engine design. I think a lot of people are drawn to it simply because it is different and unique.
I had a couple of first generation rx7s. Actually they were relatively reliable. Never had any significant problems with him and both of them went past 150,000 miles. 
I think the 13B with fuel injection was probably the sweet spot on the engine. Fuel injection made it run a lot better, but yet was still early enough that emissions regulations weren't causing problems. Not long after that I think it just became a lost cause. There was no way you were going to get that thing to pass stricter emissions regulations. Without significantly increasing the complexity which kind of defeats the purpose.
At the same time reciprocating piston designs got better and better forced induction increase the power to displacement ratio. And it kind of became pointless.
I do think there is a definite place for rotaries. People have mentioned possible generators for hybrids. They do work very well for stationary power and constant RPM.It's been such a long time since I've even thought about Hercules bikes.

Thanks for taking me down a trip through memory lane. I was always fascinated by these after seeing one for a ridiculous price in a magazine.You are one of my favourite channels, and I'm not even a big gearhead, I just think you have a really good way of sucking me into your narrative and keeping me watching till the end.You just make a Masterpiece EVERY time don't you.Hi Ryan! Your videos are the BEST thing on the internet. Everything about them is pure gold. I usually watch videos at 1.5X speed but I watch yours at regular speed to savor every second of them. Please never stop making them!!The Wankel and it's many derivatives fail vs the conventional piston engine because of its very inefficient combustion chamber. It's cursed with a large wetted area to volume ratio so the heat of combustion is soaked up by the sides of the chamber instead of doing work. The best shape for efficient combustion would be a sphere which, of course, has the most volume to surface area. Nobody has yet figured out how to couple mechanical energy out of a sphere so we are stuck with the second best shape: the cylinder. The Wankel has good mechanical efficiency (but so does a two-stroke piston engine). The Wankel excels at getting a lot of hp out of a small size but that trochoidal combustion chamber makes it uncompetitive with piston engines whenever fuel efficiency counts.Norton Raced their rotary very successfully and won the TT along with other British Superbike titles in the early 90's with the RC588.  The Crighton version of this engine produced over 200bhp from 700cc...The amount of effort you put into each episode is worth the wait. Thank you RF9Ryan,

Sachs produced a Wankle engined dirt bike with leading link front suspension in the early seventies. It was a strange beast. A family friend kept his in my father's shop. It was an interesting ride.Felix Wankel and Oskar Heil were two German engineers who had an outsized impact on my early life. I'm 47 and had a modified 2nd gen RX-7 (non-turbo) from about 1997 to 2001. And I inherited ESS AMT-1 speakers back in high school that blew me away ("sound as clear as light").I’ve watched a LOT of your videos, and I think I can put my hand on my heart and say THIS IS THE MOST ENTERTAINING one you’ve done!!! 

Love the humour, love the tech talk, and completely fascinated about where you dug that bike up from, you don’t see things like that here in the land of Oz.

Thanks for making my day!7:56 you threw the paper and it landed perfectly on the bike, how many times did you do that take, or did that just happen?!?! 
Always enjoy your videos and how you present information!The history and complexity you present on your channel is nothing short of amazing.  Thanks for your constant digging and hard work to bring us all of these gems.Hey Ryan, I laughed! I cried! (But mostly laughed!) I really enjoyed this…as usual thanks.The paper landed so smoothly on the seat, it's like even the laws of physics know your videos are perfect
The ongoing tease to the crescendo amongst every piece other of pristine editing 😍 we do not deserve this for free
Thankyou for putting out some of the best documentaries Ive seenThe thought that goes into these videos, the delivery, and production value blows my mind a bit each time. Good on ya, F9!Wow!  I saw one of these Hercules at the hot rod show in Daytona Beach Yesterday and it was in about the same shape as this one.  I was a Suzuki factory service rep when the RE5 rotary was introduced and one of my duties was to fix problems the dealer couldn't fix.  I think I worked on every RE5 that was sold in my territory.  I was never so happy to see a model dropped from our product line.The Wankel is an interesting engine, I used to have a 1984 Mazda RX-7. The engine was only good for about 100,000 miles, but that little engine could turn the RPM. I ran mine at around 10,000 RPM in 2nd gear for about a mile and backed off because I was running out of road, as I was delivering it to a dealership for trade.As a RX-7 "mechanic", I have PTSD to this day about the seals that ... don't.  Not really. Unless spinning at a steady RPM... a single good RPM.  I think Wankel's make for great generator engines ...I gotta say it, every F9 video is a work of art. Keep up the great work guys!Brilliant, insightful, and bloody entertaining as always.  You guys raise the bar with each episode.My old RX-7 used to run so smooth, the tach redline featured a loud warning buzzer to try and ensure you didn't spin the rotors right out the engine 'block'That paper flip at 7:55 was a massive flexSuzuki lost a lot of money on each RE5 they sold, but I once read that their development of apex seals ended up being what mazda needed to fix their own problems, so paid suzuki royalties for their designs for many years. So in the end it did work out for both companies. Rotaries were the engine of the future in the late 60's and into the early 70's until the problems with building and especially reliability were too big to deal with. Add to that poor economy and high emissions and everyone but Mazda gave up. Mazda may have yet another rotary powered car in the works, and anyone who drove their cars for a while will tell you the rotary is a real experience, and good one. They're actually a lot of fun and quite powerful, and easy to tune for more. I fell in love with the Rx8, almost bought one, but 16 MPG on premium was too high a price to deal with. The chassis and driveline of that car are amazing though.I have always been fascinated by the design and idea of a Wankel rotary since I first read about them in the 90s in Car & Driver.  Something captivating about each rotor doing multiple jobs at the same time.  Very cool, but in the end, simplicity often wins out.The production and care put into this video is just outstanding. Amazing work. Bravo!!Great history lesson! Loved my RX8 when I had it, it always felt like it was faster than it was.  I did wonder why they never took off in motorcycles but I guess now we know!I had a Hercules. It was a fun bike. But a problematic bike. It was odd.I rebuilt a Mazda RX 3 rotary once (in the 80's); never seen so many "rings" (the compression seals do the same thing but are not round) in my life. It was very fiddly but quite fast since the "segments" bolted together in a jiffy and the bloody thing went like a robbers dream but did not like corners or stopping much, and you needed an audible warning siren to go off to tell you when to change gears as it was impossible to "hear" any revvs and when you did there was a rubber screech on every gear - even top (!) - until (I couldnt see the speed as I was terrified to take my eyes off the road) the thing felt like it was disintegrating and I wondered where the parachute was...Later in life I was a MC Mech also and worked on the Suzuki and the Norton so I'm cursed too...you guys are awesome, your videos are so well put together. I can't wait to see what other weird bikes you guys findI would love to see Ryan could do with other content. I feel like he is one of the best creators on YouTube. Every damn video has an underlying story.The greatest mystery from the ancient bath houses of Rome, “who’s Wenkel am I touching?”

This has got to be one of the best lines I’ve ever heard. Omg, you need your own syndicated television show.The writing, camera angles, and editing are on point. But what truly makes this video great is the host. He's hilarious! Such a chill, low key presence who's relaxed demeanor emphasizes the humor. Instantly hooked. EnjoyRob Dahm has cracked the code to making rotary engines fast and reliable.Ryan, your videos are the best in ALL of YouTubeland, bar none! The best editing, the best production and the most entertaining stories. Never quit!This channel proves that as long as you have entertaining and high quality content, people will watch almost anythingRyan, your show has the interest and production values of the old top gear.  A national treasure you are (Canadian apparently, hehehe)I never really read up on rotary bikes, so thank you for condensing it down to a 10 minute video.
As much as the rotary is flawed, i still find a fascinating little thing as most of these flaws make it a brilliant piece of entertainment. Too bad that most of these vehicles become uneconomical to upkeep for most people when they blow.So happy to see the Van Veen OCR and a Hercules! Please look at what Henk Van Veen did after the Kreidler factory racing team decided tot quit 50cc GP. Van Veen has such a rich history in racing although only with smaller engines. The showoff between Kreidler, Derbi, Zundapp, Jamathi and the Japanese factory teams is worthy of an episode of it's own. Most of those German/Swiss/Dutch bikes never made it to the US/Canada because of their small bore. Zundapp exported the KS125 to America, wich is a much sought after bike here in the EU.I bought a new CBR500R the other week. 

Yesterday, a driver ran into it when I was in a roundabout. Now it’s in the shop getting repaired. 
I’m binging all of your videos until it’s fixed. You’re a legend, thanks mate.I really enjoy your reviews and gear recommendations, I want your thoughts on a 2017 Honda CRF250L Rally, I already got one and I like it so far but still want your thoughtsphenomenal video as always Ryan, you lads always get me excited with the more strange motorcycle storiesRotaries were only simple in parts count not production considerations. Remember this was also the era of the great two strokes which were far easier to modify for more hp and so easy to top end overhaul it was casually done in the pits between races.I would love to see a perfect restoration of this machine. Such a cool piece of history.Insanely good production quality, a video on something absurdly obscure yet he managed to actually find a live example, excellent scripting, and a fart joke in the middle of it all. Easily the best content on Youtube, and there's a lot of good competition.
Really interesting story on Wankel bikes, while this certainly doesn't sound like the best execution the idea still sounds doomed. People have been trying for most of a century to make practical rotary engines, but so far they've never been more than novelties or useful in very niche applications. Worst case I've heard of was when someone put a Mazda rotary in an RV-8 small airplane. All his friends called him "Cornfield," thanks to his typical landing sites - he landed in places that weren't airports multiple times before the plane finally got totaled.Awesome episode! I remember when the Suzuki RE 5 rotary came out. I went to the local dealership hoping I could test ride one. They only had one and it wasn't to be demoed. You bought it, then you could ride it.I had a Mazda RX7 (also with a rotary engine) and it was an awesome ride in its day.  Engine burned a bit of oil (by design) but it was otherwise great.  The interior panels and automatic windows kept falling apart, but the drivetrain and suspension were solid.  If someone made a rotary motorcycle I’d happily use it.Love it all! Great production work guys;  the research, the history line, the music,...„I went once to Poland in september - it was lovely. You just can’t get carried away” - a true masterpiece 👏The "Engineering Explained" channel has some good videos on the pros and cons of rotary engines, with a great explanation of how they work.Wankel, for those who think that Ducatis service intervalls are to far between and are cheap.
"I once went to Poland in September.." 😂Awesome as always!
Would love to see Ryan speaking about Suspensions. A quite underestimated topic, i guess.
All the best for the community and motorcyclists :)Ryan--
Yet another truly insightful video. 
Best motorcycle content on the web.
Keep up the great work.Somewhat off topic but how you managed to squeeze this in between non-stop pissing rain is truly impressive. That scene at Cycle BC was hysterical...
"Turn it off!"
"What???"
cough...cough...coughThe title really resonates after the conclusion. Another piece of masterful storytelling. Thank you!I believe the Norton F1 in 1991 was the last road going rotary sold. Also a race winning machine, and a bit of an icon at the time.Friend of mine had the Suzuki RE5, (the one with the Swiss roll instrument cluster) if I remember rightly it has six cables to the carburettor and air cooled exhaust pipes. Made a very distinctive sound.As an RX8 owner I had thought about how a motorcycle with a rotor engine would be and that someone should make one. BAM here it is, I had no idea there was a bike with one.I had an uncle, Pete Wiley, that invented a type of rotary engine back in the 1950s or so.  He refused to sell his design to GM and Ford and eventually Mazda introduced their wankel engine and my uncle took his to the grave with him.  He was never satisfied with the value that others placed on the technology.This is excellent film making. Great writing. Awesome editing. Thanks for a great 10 minutes!Young Clarkson vibes in this one, good video and presentationThis is ART. This is an amazing production. Writing, filming, presenting.  What a treat.I came up with an engine design but I don't know if someone already did it. The pistons fit on arms that spin around a hollow circular space molded around inside the circumference of a cylinder. The circular tube is intersected with round spinning plates with holes timed to the pistons. When the piston passes a hole in a plate, the plate rotates around closing the hole behind the piston where fuel is injected and ignited pushing the piston to the next plate where ignition is repeated.  It should have similar characteristics to a wankle if it worked at all.I don't know what they're paying you Ryan.....but it's not enough! Ask Novacap for a raise. Great content as usual.That was great fun.  Having owned not one, but two rotary engined Nortons I think you are a little unsympathetic to the NRV588.  One of the bikes I had was R1010, the factory development bike.  I would have to say that the Norton rotary was flawed but fun.  
Many of the criticisms of the period were from those who never rode one, and if you have one to day they are still a remarkably effective power plant ... sadly chassis technology does show its age.I really enjoy your videos! Thevtechnica  humour is excellent! The failure of the Wankle is owed to the  design of the "apex seal". No, they don't run forever! When I had to replace the Donk on my son's RX7, I didn't find one over 125k miles that was still alive. The fact that they use a lot of oil, also adds to their early demise, as people forget to constantly check it!Story i heard was wankell originally designed it for use as a supercharger for aircraft then discovered it could be used as a combustion engine laterMy first bike was a Hercules k125 BW V1 and it also ran on 1:25 Oil/Fuel. My mates asked if I could wait a little after the end of the school day before riding home because of the plumes of smoke that bike created and they didn't want to be behind me.Ah yes, the rotary... when I was younger I had the fortune of owning an Rx7 (during the days when they were attainable). I can attest that it is the engine that kills everything it touches, that Rx7 nearly killed me more than a dozen times! Boy was that car's engine dangerously fun"Ya just, can't get carried away" /me: has to rewind the last 30 seconds that I missed through laughing. That is some *quality* deadpan right there Ryan.Clicked on the video out of curiosity, got interested when you mentioned wankel engine since I love Mazda's, then ended up staying and watching the whole video because of how good the story telling was. I have now liked and subbed!LOL, pretty good. I attend the Vintage Festival at Barber Motorsport Park every year and there has been both Hercules and Suzuki Wankels displayed there.  Ryan did a good job of explaining why the engine was a failure.Liquid Piston made rotary engine which looks line inside-out Wankel which apparently has much better fuel efficiency and power than Wankel engine. What is interesting is that Wankel himself also was considering shape Liquid Piston made, but wasn't able to seal it properly. Who knows, maybe if he would succeed all engines now would be Wankel engines.FortNine video! Yeah! I don't even read what it's about anymore. I simply know I can trust Ryan to make an outstanding experience no matter whatSuperb presentation !I suffer from
Chronic back pain and depression due to that, it’s currently 1am and as usual I’ve been woken due to the pain but these videos are a godsend, especially at this hour of the morning! Love your work manAn interesting fact of the wankel rotary is that it is actually bester for hydrogen power then a normal piston engine cause ignition of the fuel and thus heat is localized into a separate area from the injection area reducing pre-detionation.The motorcycle yt goat the sir himself, Ryan from Fortnine never fails to deliver and always makes our days weeks months years and centuries a whole lot BETTER and more BRAAPER!!, Whenever there’s a new upload.This is Awesome. I especially like it when you explain everything so nicely. Ride Safe Y'allEvery since I read about the Wankel Engine Design back in Highschool, I thought the engineer who created it was crazy. Never mind that he was part of an even crazier regime.Look up: Inventor: "Nikola Tesla", Name of Invention: "Bladeless Rotary Turbine Engine", approximate date of U.S. Patent: 1890.
 One moving part, ZERO vibration, can be made to run as an "Internal Combustion Engine", also works with high or low-pressure steam, compressed air, gases, etc.
(It's roughly based on  his patent of ~1870, a water pump.)I actually owned and rode the Wankel made by Suzuki, the RE-5, meaning 500 cc. It was red and had the weird cylindrical instrument cluster and spherical turn signals, all thanks to Italian design firm Peninfarina. The SECOND year Suzuki sold their RE-5, all were painted black and they had normal instruments and turn signals. They still did not sell well. I got my red one for half price at the dealership, when it was a year old _demo model_ with 498 miles on it. I kept it completely stock, except I added a full fairing. That made it a joy to ride, even for long distances like 500 miles in a single day. It was perfectly comfortable cruising at 80 mph, with no numbing vibration in the handlebars or footpegs and no buffeting by the wind. It also had enormous torque, even at low rpm. There was no need to slip the clutch for a quick getaway, just crank the throttle and simultaneously dump the clutch. It went 0-to-30 mph in the width of a 2-lane intersection, barely laying rubber, with no tire squeal. For the first half of a city block, it was quicker than the screaming, clutch-frying 1100 cc piston "superbikes", despite the rather hefty weight the RE-5 had and the rather tall gearing. (It would go 50 mph in 1st gear, 80 in 2nd, and 115 mph in 3rd gear.) In highway riding at 55 mph with my friend on his 1200 cc Harley, I would challenge him to pick any gear, while I would stay in 5th gear as we simultaneously rolled on the throttles. I never failed to outpace him by a comfortable margin, despite my being in 5th gear, amounting to _second overdrive._ The only major downside of the RE-5, in my opinion, was the poor fuel economy. It got as little as 12 miles per gallon while riding it 3 miles to work, in the winter, with choke on the whole time because it took that long to warm up.A Sachs engine with a Bing carb, nostalgia overload! 12 year old me had so much fun with a Crescent Compact powered by a 50cc Sachs two stroke with a Bing carb :) Never saw a Wankel version though so truly enjoyed this vid!Absolutelly brilliant in every respect. Thank you guys.gentlemen.. we are brought back together again to witness a masterpiece.I worked for Mazda some time ago... The Rotary Engine is an amazing piece of machinery... When running properly of course... Apex seals were the weak link...Jay Leno talked about the Suzuki rotary motorcycle on one of his episodes. I think it was the 1975 RE5.I had a Mazda RX-8 for nine years. The low-RPM torque was atrocious (granted that's not a big problem for a motorcycle), the fuel economy was also atrocious, and when friends followed me in their own cars they told me the exhaust smelled like burning metal -- and that was WITH a dual-stage catalytic converter. Wankel engines are an interesting idea, but in the real world their design has fundamental flaws that cannot be overcome without changing to a different combustion chamber configuration.
I don't regret owning my RX-8, but I do regret putting myself in a position where I had to daily-drive it. Wankel engines are good toys but very bad appliances.Rotary engine is not dead. Just not used in the main power unit of road vehicles. However despite that I have a Rotary Norton. An outstanding machine produced by a small bunch of British engineers. Fuel consumption the same as my 1100 Guzzi Breva. Oil consumption 700- 800 miles to a pint.so in reality 6 pints takes you about 4000 miles. Which is actually less than my Breva where I dump 6 pints every 3000. However emissions is a different story. The Norton is no where near as smokey as the DKW. The Breva runs smoke free!Ah, the "vaccum cleaner" bike, as it was nicknamed, due to the shape of the engine front. I miss the NSU Ro 80 from the list of cars with a wankel engine, and a fantastic exterior design about a decade ahead of its time. But it was no big success either, technical problems at the start (through solved within a year), needing lots of fuel and a sharp fuel price rise, combined with the fact that the new owner of NSU, Volkswagen, had a similar sized car with the Audi 100, saw to that.I love it!A guy I know has 6 of the Susuki rotary bikes. It's all he rides. It keeps up fine. But gas mileage isn't great.Awesome!  I wish there was more. I will be happy with less though as long as the quality continues!Love hurts...

Your music keeps me breathingThis hits different when you're still healing from a breakup 😪@Dax , keep doing you brother. You have some real ass lyrics in your songs . What these religious folk don't understand is people like us probably have a closer relationship with the creator. If you can't be honest with yourself about who you are, how can you expect to be honest with anyone else? 💯i’m late sorry but i love your songs never give up man your definitely top 5 best rappersThanks for this track .
I really can relate to every lyric in it and trust me our storyline is similar💔
Indeed love hurts when you give it all in 💔This song is absolutely genius and many people relate. For everybody that’s dealing with heartbreak just know there are plenty more fish in the sea!Aye Dax. We overlook lyrics for the hype of the song but I love you man and if you ever going through anything just take a look at the messages you spread and know they apply to you as well❤️ blessDax spilled our hearts on a page to produce this song!!! Legendary relationI have listened to this song so many times. It's crazy how much l can relate. Thank you 💕💕I felt this one to the core 💔💔 I found out my wife of 5 years has been cheating on me the last 5 months as far as I know 😭😭 thank you Dax I know someone is with meThis song is helping me so much with coping since my now ex cheated and left me after a year of abuse. I feel so stupid for wasting my time with someone who used me and didn’t care. God bless you Dax.💖I was in a relationship for 5 years and was cheated on last month. This'll be my first Valentine's day alone in 5 years man dax I appreciate you dropping this I can't stop listening much love manThis song hits hard and bangs the nail right on the head this songs perfect but sad DAX is very talented well done 👌I stg I've listened to dax on repeat for weeks.. I legit fit into all his sore spots.I love u dax u are amazing I've never connected to someone's music like I have yoursThis song hits way too close to the heart. Was with a woman for 10+ years only to go visit my parents in Spain, get a phone call telling me not to come home....that was 4 years ago and it's all fresh in my head. That woman was the only thing that ever mattered to me in my entire life, then several thousand kilometers away, I get my heart ripped out and crushed. When Dax says "You fucked up my head And what’s crazy is i’d probably do it all again" is very true. She's worth going through that all again.this song HIT HARD when you can relateDax doesn't realize this, but he is making everyone's quarantine better.“Ain’t it crazy how we built for 2 years but it took 10 seconds and a bad decision to break all of it loose” that fr hit hard😔❤️i love how real his lyrics are and heart felt they are and how smoth his words are i love his voice and him music bro hard he needa go to the top !Damn bro im going through so much shit right now. This song connects so much. Bro, for real thanks for making music.Last year I was going through a hard time and this song helped me through.  This year I'm in an even worse place again and I can just cry to it :(Damn that's a hell of a bar. My life is like a museum, everyone buys tickets but never stay that long. I felt that one Dax.Your literally killing me with the truth  Dax!! I’m struggling with all I ever knew ! But however I appreciate the reality of the truth! Your speaking everything I’ve been thru 💔😭I love Dax 💯 He so real & I relate to his music so much !!!Just got out of a relationship where I got cheated on. I'm heartbroken and angry and this song hits different right now. Definitely helping me through it.We don’t get used to the pain. Life distracts us but when the time comes and our mind has time to think everything sinks in and pain comes back.I pray that a beautiful, kind hearted, loving and goal oriented woman enters Dax’s life and shows him that not all Women are the same. I pray that this woman loves him til death, and shows him the real true meaning of love, so that these songs he writes can be scars and not open wounds.  

Bless up Dax.  You’ll find that one girl that gives just as much love as you give one day.  Keep doing you and working on yourself to become the best version of yourself possible. 
The heart that’s meant to love you, will follow suit. 

Much love and respect to you brother.  I’m currently going through the same things, and for the past few months, this song explains my entire feelings.I love it how he brought that out on the 14th of february, love hurts especially when the person that you love doesn't put you first - nothing but true words.I literally just found him and I’m already in love with his musicOnly Dax can make a depressing song into a legendary song and can relate to how I feelBro I’m going thru a lot n I actually finally cried after a 3 ur relationship where I did everything for her, n this song spoke so many words please keep going! And thank you, you definitely gave me encouragement to start writing myself again.This song literally explained almost word for word what I just went through right down to the fuckin birthday man. Love your music an I can't tell ya how much I doNever heard words that describe my last relationship so well until this was recommended to me. Found a new favorite artist.You took the rap game to a whole different level bruh. #Hatsoff.wow just found you dax this hit me hard. my first love cheated and I made a promise to myself that i would never cheat but... despite it being years im still stuck in the cycle of pain of getting cheated onStill at the top !!!!! 
DAX ..... the GRATE"I'm still haunted by the day that you left, I'm not good enough but i still gave you my best" why does dax have to be such a godThe line “my life is like a museum, everybody shows up and buys tickets but they never wanna stay that long.” That line hit me hard. Had me thinking about all the relationships I’ve been in. Love this song also. 💯Man spoke from his heart this is real musicI definitely relate to this myself. I've only been actually IN LOVE with 1 man. I got strung along for about 10 years all together with him being back and forth all the time and he played with my mind the entire time. We are still friends and he still wants to get some, but it's too hard just being friends. He still plays with my head. I wish I could just forget all those memories. I hope I can fall in love again like that but I believe there is only 1 person that we fall madly and deeply in love with. Loving anyone else for me, probably won't ever be at 100%. But thats life and what doesn't kill us...."Only woman i can trust is my mom" 
BIG FUCKING FACTS ... 
Great St Valentine's Day song .... 
😭🥀💔I feel this song in my soul 💚Loving  and losing hurt greatly but so does loving someone who only sees you as a acquaintanceYou hear Dax's pain in every single song no cap...This hits hard dax. Keep yo head up we need you. 💯Damn Dax you went in on this one. STAY TRUE TO YOULittle does he know, he has saved so many lifes including my own. Depression and anxiety are real. I live it every damn day. And unfortunately only thing thats keeping my head up are dax's songs. Dax if you see this I just wanted to thank you for all your music. every song I can relate to. And alot of the songs saved me from taken my life. Any time when things were dark you gave me motivation to keep fighting and never giving up not only to my self but also my dreams. So that I thank you for dax. Much love from okc 🖤‘Love hurts especially when the person you love doesn’t wanna put you first’ that hit hard at home for me. I seriously don’t understand why people hate Dax he’s literally amazing."I'd probably do it all again", It's that doormat mentality that keeps us all trapped within the devastation. Happiness is out there and it will come for us all. For all reading this, your time is near!dude all i can say... 
i feel you if i could tell you my story 
you would have at least two albums 
of why life can tear you downHe truly rap for the people!!! 
His engagement with his fan is ridiculous, he always respond and care about the impact he create!
Best rapper of this generation period!Received the same birthday present myself🤬 This one hits the soul 💔 I have felt the pain, bounced back and thrived ❤ Helps to know you are not alone, Sending love to all who need it❤❤❤ Pay attention to actions not words, valuable advice 🙏I'm so disappointed that i hadn't thought to see the music video until now, love you and your music man...stay strongDax's music Pierce is my soul and touching my heart cuz I can relate to damn near everything he's talking aboutI love that dax actually raps in a way i can understand way better than other rappers. it makes me actually feel the lyricsThanks For Watching <3  If you enjoyed this video, will also probably Last Video from this series :D https://youtu.be/6y8KyCX1378quick word: killing the dragon counts as winning the manhunt, but going in the portal is not needed, it was claimed in the manhunt rulesimagine being a hunter and not knowing the win condition for the runner to winHi P0land, love you vids! I watch your streams and love your content. I already know this is gonna be a banger!Honestly I think these r so entertaining u deserve more fame nglI love how at the end they tried to say YOU DIDNT GO THROUGH THE PORTAL in some desperate last resortBy now a more entertaining video would be where the hunters get an OP twist.Ur editing has gotten so much better since u we’re doing skeppy challenges keep up the good work 👍Within the first minute, he and his horse were already on half a heartKeep up the nice manhunt vidsThose replay mod shots were epicLove the content keep it up broNah the official manhunt rules say: "if the ender dragon dies in any way even if the hunters kill it the speedrunners still winLove ur videos mate. Keep up the good workPoland making a normal manhunt:Intalling hack...
Also Poland :Oh no... AnywaysThe hunters were told what the twist was and they could have killed each other to get tons of themDo that again but with more enchants for example:
Summoner  -  Summons - clones around you that can attack, but they only have half the health.make a movie in which there is manhunt but everyone has Polish language setWhenever Poland Uploads you know its gonna be a goood day ;)I sometimes feel bad for the hunters but I sometimes don't.Axes do more damage, you should use them more often for pvpanother BANGER of a vid, kkep up the good work P0LANDMinecraft Manhunt, But the hunters always have a disadvantage.That was the fastest 2 minutes in my life from  nothing to diamondsAnyone know what is the plugin that allows you to enchant your stuff without the anvil, like in the inventoryPoland's videos are always op💛I love your vids, keep it upMe wondering why the hunters don't just gear up so that P0land can't get the heads and then kill him in the end easily cause he has no hacksThat's the win for poland even though he didn't go through the portalwhen you trick shot the dragon with aimbot…I love when these types of videos come outi like how poland and his horse have half HPImagine being a citizen of that village...just seems epic just from the intro good ideaKeep it up Poland!!!I’ve been waiting sooo long for this lolto bylo giga Koks :), Super sie ogladalo.Still not at the end of the video,but couldn't hunters kill eachother to farm the enchants?I like this kind of new editing style I know it’s not to different but I like it still lolmulti shot is not a custom enchant its a enchant for the crossbowNo time is too late for poland contentYou have all the requirements to  win a manhunt except one *Dont cheat*Fact:multishot is a real enchantment idk if its only on bedrock but it only works on crossbowsBest manhunt idea EVERAh yes the trick shot when he literally had aimbotI feel like Poland deserves to be on the LifeSteal SMP, he could probably wipe out the entire server in just a matter of seconds.I don't know what you are doing but keep it up there is something that makes me enjoy this so much lolTHAT MLG WATER BUCKET AT 4:38 WAS INSANEbro you should make long videos like 20 to 30 mins of manhunt It will be more intreasting and love from indiapoland makes everyone happy and i just love your videos polandWhat's the texture pack ur using?

Minecraft but kills give haxsMatip's gotta be the most unintentionally funny man ever. He doesn't even realise it😂I thought that after Gerrard left, I'd always feel like something is missing from the team. But I can honestly say, that this is my absolute favourite Liverpool squad that I've seen in my life. If Gerrard was there as a player as well, then it would be the most perfect. This squad that we have right now, I like them all, not one player who I think doesn't deserve to be there. Top lads, all of themEven Virgil's voice is strong and dominating, much like his CB skills.As an Arsenal fan I just love the teams energy, so much chemistry and everyone is happy.Jurgen Klopp approaching that kid himself and getting a picture clicked speaks highly of Klopp. The man could have several flaws as a coach, but he has an exceptional humane side. He connects with his squad deeply. He truly loves the players and the club.Robbo's always the cheeky annoying guy that everyone openly insults but secretly can't live without...It’s still hurts for Karius! Man, despite mistakes like every human does, you are still LFC family and we, fans, forgave you everything! Be strong and have a great shape! YNWAAmerican Liverpool fan here. This team made me fall in love with this sport, every single player makes me happy in their own way. I lost my girlfriend 5 years ago and the message of YNWA and camaraderie of the players and fans has endeared me to this club forever ❤️I’m glad to see smile from Karius. Hope he can recover his confidence and has a chance to play in some teams.From what I see is that there are no star allures within this team, which makes this this team so strong. Well done all of them!Virg and Matip are hilarious togetherLove Thiago driving Harvey around at the end 🙏Thiago driving Harvey around in the golf cart is too funny 😂love this whole squad, they're just a pleasure to watch, tons of banter, they all love and respect one another, and THAT is one of the many reasons I love LFCLove this club one big happy family, the team banter , the way Thiago drove Harvey back real touching to see thatI think Virgil loves Matip more than he loves his wifeWhat a turnaround Klopp has made since he came to LFC. He made players and staff like a big family and made this club relevant again ❤️VVD: Being everyone's dad. I imagine him as a father being 'Firm...but fair'. May he father us to many more trophies 😊Watching Harvey on the crutches bring tears. He is such a tough lad.THIS IS SUCH A FAMILY CLUB IT EVEN GIVES US FANS A SENSE OF BELONGING . YNWAIt's very nice to see liverpool. The players chemistry is amazing inside and also outside the fieldsVirgil’s face when the lady says well done to him. I’m not ashamed to admit that I watched that on repeat a few timesVirg is like one annoying faithful friend that you can't live withoutIt's great to see Harvey moving around.  You'll never limp alone! 😂😂Touch of class by Klopp at the end 👏 🇮🇪I’m a man United fan but I can’t get enough of watching these videos. This squad’s just so wholesomeThiago driving Harvey off the pitch. Gonna be some midfield duo when back fit…why i’m always happy whenever Loris is in the first team, this guy don’t deserve to be hated.We need a series with just Virg & Joel😂 give the people what they want 🔥Van Dijk has got great spirits... You can see how he uplifts the team.Feel bad for Karius, must be hurting inside behind that smile, two mistakes ruined everything for him 😥Taki broke Japanese code of arriving on time😂Mo's giving Robo the backhand slap flash, and Hendo is laughing hard, my fav, lolone of our strongest lineup... happy to see these guys in groups... they are funny like in familyIt's kinda heartwarming to see Karius in the group. 🌹Great team 👏 Great squad 💪
I hope Liverpool have all tittles in this season 🙏I love this team. You will never walk alone Liverpool FCSeeing Karius in uniform and smiling made my dayMan! You gotta feel for  Karius. It must be a mental torture training every day and being with the team with no hope of playing. I hope he can move on in January and salvage what is left of his Career.The depth of this squad is amazing. Look at the keepers man!Their bantering was what a team is all about 😂👍👍You get used to it, after 5 or 6 years it's fine.

Jurgen Klopp on British weather2:45 historic photo. One of the best era of liverpool.Team photo? More like a family photo to me 😍❤Harvey Elliot almost made me cry. he was playing so wellLove them all. They bring us Lfc fans so much joy. YNWAI really feel for Karius. Sincerely hope he has a 2nd chance. Everyone deserves a 2nd chance.That chemistry ❤️❤️❤️Good to see Harvey able to stand unsupported, can’t wait to have him back 🙌🏻Class act from Thiago driving Harvey Elliot back to the building .👏👏👏Despite what happened against Madrid in the final, I still want Karius to be a part of the family. Same goes for Adrian, Lovren, Moreno. 

YNWA ❤️There are few loves that compare to Virgil's love for Joel MatipI can’t live in Liverpool but Liverpool lives in me 🤜🏿I think that this season is going to be a massive test for us - especially after what happened to us last season. 

The real test will come when AFCON starts, and we lose Salah, Mane,and Keita for one month. 

 If we can get through that, then we will have a great chance gor the Title and Champions League.God I love this team <3Matip's walk is way too funny man lmaoo XDLucky are the players who have the opportunity to be part of their Great Teams. Memorable... these kind of pictures togetherness ,World Cup , Champions league and others means loads to the fans and players.Tbh seeing Karius back is interesting 
We never was a world class keeper but not bad as a 3rd choicei remember the last time i say this was when we got stevie g, torres, alonso and mascherano. but look at that, WHAT A TEAM!Completely forgot about the guy named Karius. It’s crazy how one game can destroy goalkeeper’s mentality and entire career. Best of luck to the man.simply the greatest clubside of all timesLove these group of lads so much ❤️❤️Like a big boy family 😊😊😊.
Jürgen Klopp is a great father ❤️Honestly Matip needs a statue. Never known a player to be such a hilarious person without him knowing 😂The chemistry between them is so goodKloppo showing his personal skills by chatting with a (I guess) junior player.
That made his day for sure.These players are just talentedGod! I love my club❤️Klopp is basically a father figure at this stageThis is a great club. Great common sense planning behind the scenes not just throwing money & trying to get the most expensive players & thinking that will bring success. Manchester's B team should learn from this.So happy to see harvey on the ground. What a kid man!Nice to see Karius back smiling with the lads 💪When Robbo thought that Salah wanted to shank hands but nah, and his reaction was hilarious Lmfao 1:15Love Thiago moment ❤️I'm really happy to see Karius smiling again ❤️This isn't really connected to football but VVD has got amazing manners in every video he is in 😀I love the banter the players have with each otherVirgil always care to each other, well done Virgil, well done!Jurgen pays much attention to the players, he knows the players' character.Mid fielders and forward are mostly at the front because of their height which is more compatible with their position of play due to their low C. O. G hence them being shorterGlad to see karius happy here..this team is like family.just realized our GK squad depth is pretty amazing considering how keepers squad depth usually are. I hope to see Karius play a game this year tho, that man needs a redemption arcmatip never fails to make me cry hahahaha it's so unintentional as wellLove to see Karius on the team.👍❤Love Van Dijk and Matip friendship ❤️are we gonna ignore how thiago and elliot are in recovery together... when they both get back  gonna be an mega duoOMG Karius is Back. Lovely to see him in the arena😍Now That's A Team with "Great Team Spirit" Virg n Matip bantering, Mo Robbo n Hendo Bantering, Even Karius laughing with the other Keepers, Klopps Smile n Thiago Shauffering Elliott around in A Golf Cart! Brilliant 👏 👏 We've Got a Great Set of Lads n Players 👏 YNWA xLove big Virg and Matip! What a pair! 💯❤️❤️❤️🙌🏽This is not a team but a family Liverpool FC ❤️👊 YNWA 🔥🔥Virg has such a big presence in the squad.Loved the ending with Elliott on the back of the kart hope he gets a quick recoveryCant believe Karius still there 😹 well done son. Hope he gets a chance to redeem himself.1:56

Teacher: Well-done Virgil! Well-done! 
Virgil: Thank you very much. Thank you. (with proud smile)I'm a manchester united fan but this team and coach make me want to support liverpoolIt’s a family thing ,this got me smiling 😁Love this club so much😍😍😍!!Matip's walk & squeaky feet absolutely done me🤣🤣Good atmosphere with the squad. All mixing and listening to each others jokes etcEveryone talking about virg matip Thiago and all
But it's sad to see karius's face,he seems so sad even when he's smiling
One bad match and he lost all of his confidence and stopped believing in himself😔
Hope atleast he gets to play the cup matchesLove it, Love Them, Love LFC,  LFC for Life, YNWA TEAM!Nice to see Elliot quick recovery lad ❤️My team ❤️it's really heart warming reading comments abt karius... lfc fan base is the best... no hate just real disappointment and everything else in klopp we trust!Lol, hope somebody else catches this. At 1:02, robbo realizes Trent is in the back line. Jealous he says "its your stupid hair!" before tying his boot hahaThis team ❤️The injured guys at the end, one a driver and the other passenger😂🤣What a squad!I wish I get a chance to play in Liverpool ❤️Robbo shouting moment😭 love this team vibes ❤️0:21 to 0:28 Just imagine every Liverpool player walked into the pitch doing the Joel Matip Majestic Walk in every match 😂😂😂Their circle is just... wowwJurgen calling KT "The Greek Scouser" is sending me 😂glad to see karius there, give him a chance please🙌Great to see Harvey still here for the picture! Even funnier Karius peeking in the back row 🤣Harvey standing still in the photo without crutches! He will be back on the pitch soon 👊love this group of lads...❤️LFCSeeing Salah makes me happy.Love the smile and the yeahhh … best day of his lifeMatip: *act normal*
Van Dijk: "Look at him, the majestic one" 😂😂😂One big family ❤️Great team .. Great spiritMaybe we can give Karius one or two appearances.. although he cost us the champions league but maybe he improving since thenAwww man I wish I could be in the team 😫😭Give some love to Karius,you still one of the member in LFC family ♥️Would love to see Mbappe/Haaland in the team photo next season 😉😉Not a Livrpool fan but seeing Karius felt good idk whyCan't believe Karius is standing in there and even able to smile.Andy is such an uplifting character lolHarvey on his crutches breaks my heart manThey have such a good environment.WE ARE LIVERPOOL. WE WANT MORE.Karius chillin' like a villain in the back. Hope he can still get a few good years at another club next season. He is no Allison of course but man talk about being unlucky.I couldn't imagine... it's very cold outside... stay cool in uniform... well doneFinally they put Karius smiling in their videos! Only took them 100 yearsVirgil : red boot, ballon d'or candidate, look at majestic walk. He never fails to troll matip😂😂🤣1:15 when salah came , they acted as if they were talking behind his back and laughing, then robbo changed to a sudden serious tone as if they got busted 😂😂😂1:35 that broke my heart,watching him like that❤️
YNWA HARVEYAlways a fun time with all the guysSo good to see Harvey ❤️Oh I wish it's a long video not just a team photoshoot haha but 
Robbo: Why am always in the front?
Virgil: Cos you're small hahahaEven Virgil's voice is strong and dominating, much like his CB skills.
Matip's gotta be the most unintentionally funny man ever. He doesn't even realise it😂
Virg 100% runs the "no context Joel Matip" account on twitter. The man is OBSESSED with him 😂😂Virgil Van Dijk always wants Joe Matip to say something, but Matip is a little bit shy kind of a lad, doesn't want to say much or draw attention to himself. Matip is like Chelsea's N'Golo Kanté, these two players just want to play football, no drama at all.been a while since I've seen the legend Karius in the pool kit, hope he's alright 🙏Robbo : "Why am I always on the front?"

Virgil: "Because you're short." 

LolMore of these informal pure videos please 😍❤️I always said that Eggs is not at the level of Liverpool and so is Lovren, and they are gone now. I say that Matip is not at the level of Liverpool. A good defender is required, as well as an alternative midfielder for Wijnaldum and Milner no longer has anything to offer. I do not know that there is a compliment in his presentation, sometimes or not. 100 million fans of Salah team wish you the bestWho agrees that robbo always makes Liverpool so entertaining and interestingTrent looks so satisfied to stand behindHappy to see karius is back again 🤝👏Depois da fatídica final da Champions League 2018, se fosse aqui no Brasil Loris Karius não passava nem na calçada do clube !Robertson is so hilariousIf thiago and Arnold are fit enough for the photo they can participate in the city game for sureVirgil is a different Vibe ❤️😅In the old days I always buy the poster photo LFC, in the market. Now just see how the team make it.❤YNWAour defenders are so funny 😂😂😂Photograph of champions. This season is ours its time for golden sky.So happy to see Elliott ♥️YNWA forever 💪🔥Happy to see Harvey Elliot in front row!👍👍Happy to see Karius again, hope he is in starting eleven once againSo great to see Harvey, some weight bearing on left foot is a good sign!Joel's majestic walk 😌😂😂Virgil is like big guy who teasing every mate in his class especially innocent matip😂VVD and his obsession over Matip is insane 🤣Giant Klopp!👍I’m Madrid fan, somehow bumped into this video and loved how Karius smiled in this video. It’s hypocritical for me to say that “I wish he didn’t do mistakes in the UCL final” because obviously Madrid deserved to win, but I wish Karius the best always.what a teamThere is always a kid like Robbo in our class 😂 One that refuses to tie his shoelaces and grumbles about ‘stupid hair’ bcs it makes his friend look taller 🤣i always feel emotional when i see karius🥲idk why....VVD: Being everyone's dad. I imagine him as a father being 'Firm...but fair'. May he father us to many more trophies 😊Glad to see you back TOTThis will be buried under all the love your fans have for you, but hell man, you have been missed. I hope your family is doing well after your loss. 
Your videos brought me so much fun. I will probably never be in a position to do the awesome creative stuff you do, but watching you do it made me feel good. Your blend of humor and your family friendly vibe relaxed me. I work in the trades and just watching you work and make dad humor made the world a better place for me, and obviously a million others too.
I remember the 100k video joking about 1M. Congratulations on being there now.
You have definitely earned it. 
Thank you.Just seeing this video show up literally brought a tear to my eye. Whenever and how often you're ready Tony is good enough for all of us.Always makes my day watching your, sometimes random videos. As an engineer i always love your projects, i can appreciate the work that goes into them. Glad you’re back pal.The casters from aluminum is of course impressive, but how did you get the surface finish to look like wood for those shelves? You truly are a master.Welcome back, you have been extremely missed. Some parts of life can not just be fixed with a ninja chop and smart editing. I really hope things are for the better mow. Much love to you and your family from all the 1.030.000 million of us.Love to see you back :)
Congrats for all you wonderful work, which is always inspiring.As always Tony, well done. A word of caution on the new chuck setup. Make sure the chuck is rated for the RPM you plan to spin it at. Some chucks are rated as high speed chucks and some aren't. Take care.Cant tell you how happy I am to see you back. Youre part of the reason why I got into machining. Now I can finally rewatch your old videos without getting sad XD.Can’t begin to properly express how nice it was to hear your voice/jokes/etc.  Hope all’s well in your universe.Thanks for posting a new video. Your videos help me unwind and I really appreciate all the time effort and expense you put into them. Your understated humor always lifts my mood. I wish you good luck and good fortune, sir.If you need anymore “definitely totally random” viewers to come ogle your shop, you know where to find me@TOT, absolutely wondiferous to see you back at it sir. Good health to you and yours. I've been so busy myself that I had to wait almost 2 weeks to watch this. I mean I could have let it play with cc on or something like that but your videos are worth carving out time to fully appreciate the whole production. Visually and audiologil, aduiomatik, ahhhh... and with my ears.Your skills are as impressive in machining as in humor and video editing and everything you do! Exceptionally raising the machines and using the childs🤣
Well done again Tony !YAY! TOT is back!!!!!! 

You inspired me to take machining classes and I just started my first job as a machinist recently. Can't wait to see what future videos you come up with!The G.O.A.T. is back and looking better than never! Can't wait for more updates and don't hurry or worry, we all love you and your videos, no matter if they take a week or a month TOT! <3Its nice to see 3D printing and "classical" metal machining working togetherThere he is! So good to see a new video and update from you Tony. Congrats on the 1M subs and those machinist awards for your kids are awesome! Keep them coming  😎👍Very happy to see you back on YouTube Tony! It's a sign that our society is finally getting through the pandemic -- like seeing crocuses budding in Spring.

Good to hear that you bought a MIG welder. The TIG welder makes for better video footage and pretty weld beads, but if you just have to stick some mild steel together, the MIG is the practical choice.I actually can't explain how much I missed your videos.   You're a great inspiration and I'm so excited to see you back in the shop.Tony is back! I think this is the most positive thing I've had happen this year so far! I've missed you, Tony, in the manliest  of ways of course,  and I'm grateful you  are back!The editing is getting so damn good man! Looking forward to the new projectsI’m so glad you’re back! I forgot how much I love the humour you put into your videos, somehow makes the learning process easier 👍🏻A “Stuff Made Here” and a “This Old Tony” in the same day… what the heck!!! Always grateful that you are willing to share your talents with the world!Awesome, great to see you back. You taught me a bunch of things my lazy greek job instructor at work wouldn't or couldn't and I'm happy to see that you and your kids are doing well.I did not realize how much I missed this man until now. I for one am glad our man of mystery is back and with new reckless abandon!Tony you bring inspiration to our generations, Thank you.  Hope you're doing spectacular too(Hands down).You probably won’t see this Tony, but I think while so many comments here are expressing their happiness that you’re back (a sentiment that I share), I just wanted to say that I’m glad that you did the sane thing by taking the time off.

Sometimes us fans/followers can act like a bunch of baby birds, hanging around with our mouths gaping open, chirping to be fed. I know that a lot of creators feel quite a bit of pressure from it (not to mention The Algorithm), and it’s refreshing to see someone setting an example by prioritising what’s actually important. I hope that you’ll do the same in the future should you need to again. We’ll still be here.In the time you've been gone I graduated high school, and then I started my career as a CNC machinist after being inspired by watching what you were able to do with simple machines in your garage. Welcome back man, we've all missed you"honestly, i do *way* more than my kids do" - tony you never fail to make me laughAbsolutely stoked to see you back TOT! Love the humor and looking forward to cool new shop shenanigans.Riveting as always, you really have way with the words that make us guys proudGreat to see you back.
Quite a lot to go through in your ‘first one back” video. I would have been happy with a short video on the bolts and nuts of how to train your cat to poop bolts and nuts.Just as it looks like the end of the world is just around the corner and depression is creeping in TOT saves the day and cheers us all up! Good to see you back!Did anyone else scream "YESSS!!!" Across their shop when they saw T.O.T. flash across the screen? Good to have you back!
-WillHope your family is ok Tony. So dang happy to see you back!!Fabulous editing, witty commentary, the complete package.  Welcome back!It’s great to see my favorite machinist on YouTube is back in action!You were missed, very nice to see you back at the grind.Good to see you back TonHappy to see you again Tony. We've all missed your dad humor.Treeeemendous to see you back, young Tony. Looking forward to more great tips and tricks. Keep 'em coming. Thank you.You have no idea JUST HOW MUCH I missed your videos - It's wonderful too see your return. I really hope everything is OK with you and your family :-)I love this guy for his random humor as much as his fantastic shop tips.Honestly great to see Tony back. Really enjoy this stuff.Thanks Tony, glad you're back and the kids liked it!
We've missed ya.

Btw, its pronounced Roetz ... :)One of, if not the most, underrated youtubers. I was happy as a clam to see a new video. Been watching TOT since 2017 and will be watching forever.Is it sad that I was truly worried about the well-being of a man I've never met or whose face I've only seen once? I say nay! Never happier to see a pair (or on certain occasions, trio) of hands in my life. Good to have you back ToT.Absolutely wonderful video.  Five stars for your creative genius made so entertaining.  Makes me want to go out into my shop and make the world a better place by doing something like taking the backlash out of some gears, or sharpening the chain on my old Stihl, just in case I need to trim some limbs.Man is it good to see you here again!!!!  I genuinely got bummed out thinking you gave up on videos!  You are a legend!!!!And when the world needed him the most, he returned!Fantastic to see you again Tony! For your mill tool holder attachment may suggest mold plate alignment pins and bushings. I used them for attachments on a laser engraver we have mounted on a Bridgeport mill base. Bushing in the table so it doesn’t interfere when it’s not used. Pin half in the tooling. Hardened and precise the ones I use are .3125 pin dia. Works great everything repeats. Send me a message I’ll get you a part number. MSC sells them.Super Yes Tony, your kids are adorable. I love that you involve them with a trade. Too many kids are lost in TheTickTock these days. Great work!Good to have you back Tony!! I was just thinking about how my TOT withdrawals were finally subsiding. Now I’m jones’n for more. Keep ‘em coming dude!I've missed you, ToT! Congrats on the new video! I wish you all the best, greetings from a far-away Bulgarian fan 😊Glad to see your smiling...err hands again. A few things have happened in the last 7 months. Adam now has a torque wrench appendage (not sure if that equates to more viewers). Rob is seeing a 10EE and the Hardinge is not to happy. Tom is in an underground bunker doing secret stuff for NASA. Keith has a new game show "Turning for Dollars". Ron got a contract with Walmart for aluminum dustpans. And finally, Stefan hired the winged monkeys from Wizard of Oz to make flux capacitors. Good to have you back Tony.When the world needed him most... HE RETURNEDIt's great having you back, TOT. What do you think about some sort of vertical (or would it be horizontal?) quick-change tool post for holding the tools to the vise or table? You already have the tool offsets from the lathe DRO and you won't have to take them out of the tool holders.Good to see you back. The four jaw on the mill would have solved some tough problems for years ago that went to someone else that had 24 inch lathe.Hands down the best entertainment you can find on YT. 
Glad to see you back Tony.I hope all is well with the family.  I am so happy to see you are back!OMG! Am I dreaming? We have to celebrate this!! :)

And congratulations to the kids for their awards.The switch to camera 2 with the slow turn, for a hands only shot. It's the little things that make me love this channel's humorSo good to see you, welcome back sensei Tony! Turning that ball was sweet! Hope your insurance got you covered for the tree accident! :)Love it. Can't wait for more TOTGlad to see you outputting videos again. This may sound weird and overly sentimental.  My wife and I watched a bunch of your videos on our honeymoon in April. Your vids were a normal topic of conversation.  We missed your videos and wish your family the best. :)Can't tell you just how much we've missed this stuff!Great to have you back,  that Synergy reference was truly outrageous.  truly, truly, outrageous.Welcome back! We have missed your channel!
Condolences for the tough times the family has been thru. Wonderful to see you back sharing your sense of humor!Tada! The wait is over and TOT delivers as always. 👍
Nice to have you back. Take care.Two different CNC’s for the price of one conversion! Love it, glad you’re back! 👍We have missed you, TOT.  Made my morning to see this video pop up on my feed.I wish I could subscribe a million times...
Your videos always brighten my day!Dude, I’m sooooo glad you’re still alive out there! Hope everything is going well, maybe you can post once in a while again!So glad you're back!!!!! These have been hard times, rewatching old Tony videos again and againHey TOT, Glad to see things are back to the shop, i recently came across a project that my machinist father in law does not want to try, thought id throw it at you. I need to make a New bit for a old Stanley power planer/router. its the H-39-b. if you or anyone else would be interested in taking on that project please let me know! thank you!Thank God you're back. I nearly broken down and bought my own lathe and mill to get my fix. This should hold me over for another week. Until then, my savings account thanks you.It's always entertaining to watch someone spend 3x as much making something instead of just buying a thing that already does what they want off the shelf.  Not sarcasm btw.  It really is entertaining and I do it myself too often.I thought this moment would never come ... I missed you, TOT! What a happy day!There is a trick for using the telltale. If the tree fell over the wrong way, you can just roll it a few feet until it turned by 180° and the telltale will now be under the tree, saving you the hassle of putting the tree back up again.Good to see you back!

Your videos are so much fun! I love them.I missed you Tony. So glad you're back. Hope you're doing well!Missed your videos!! Glad your back. 

Just so you know the MS290, MD310, and MS390 arev all the same body, so it will work with a few other saws then just the 290. :) 

Have a great day.Oh my god have I missed you! So happy to see you back Tony! :D Always a pleasure!Rarely do I exclaim with joy when my fave creators put up a new video, but today I did! 
First off; Congrats on the 1 mill subs. 
Secondly; Im so happy to both see a new video from you Tony, and also to see that you've decided to keep making videos with the same quality, quirky puns, great editing and ... straight up fantastic content! You still got it!

Im super glad you're back and still Im looking forward to your videos with barely conteined glee!............Speechless......... So happy to see him back.I KNEW IT!!!!! That QR code was good, I knew you wouldn't pass up an opportunity like that. I'm so glad you're back, missed you tons!Did not disappoint; most non-clickbait title possible. Found it concise and to the point. Description was accurate as well.I was so excited to see this uploaded I ran to told my wife. She didn't seem to understand the magnitude of Tony being back.It's hard to express how happy it makes me that a dude I never met uploaded a video again after months, and where the last bit of news we had was bad news (or at least sad). So glad you're back!
Also: Congrats on the million!You're a national treasure, Tony.So glad you are back!! Thank you for always providing great content!Not a fan of trophy's, but that image you conjured in my head hit the spot.
Good on U/Tube for recognizing one of the Greats, but a stack of cash would have been sweeter.Welcome back Tony! So glad you’re safe and sound. Hope you and your family are doing better after such trying events.Welcome back, This Old! I hope things are coming together for you and your family.I love the travelers reference! That was such a good show!All that stored up thisoldtony energy came pouring out in this one.I am SOOO HAPPY to see you again TOT!!!!!  Glad you're back!!!!I am so glad you are back.  I missed your videos.  Would love to see you weld steel to wood to make that bench.I was expecting half of this video to be Tony just trying to start the chainsaw

2020 may have sucked, but 2021 brought Clickspring and This Old Tony back to us. What a time to be alive!Welcome back Tony you and your videos were greatly missed sir.Absolutely love this channel.So glad you're back and on top form, old bean. Also, congratulations on the one Mega-subscriber... they'll see them from the ISS towering over your shop!Happy your making new videos again...Enjoy them all...Please make a lot more!Congrats on 1 million! Love the kid awards an awful lot. So wonderful to see you again! Didn't realize how much I was missing your special editing style and all other things!So glad you're back with us!! Keep up the great work =)Reading the comments here must give us all hope. Why? Because there’s a lot of love in the world. This site gives me hope every time I come here. Thankyou sir, for a wonderful channel with great content. All the best to you 👍👍I once set up "base camp" under an old apple tree for my youngest cousin. I buried an axe into the trunk and asked her to tell me what the tree said about that. Six days later, she told me the tree said "Ouch!" .. OK, let's cut up the dead one over there. She worked the other end of a two man crosscut saw, at age nine, better than most men can do. Sometimes it's not a new fangled modified tool you need. Rather, just a good friend on the other end of an old one... She's in her forties now and we both watch your channel. ☺️He's back! I can feel my inspiration growing already!Had me in stitches again!
Good to see you're back!The master returns & hasn’t lost his touch! Congrats on the well deserved success. 

Sorry for your family’s loss.I sure did miss those rapid fire corny jokes. No kidding, I checked TOT's channel for new content like 2 days before this upload, prayers answered.So glad things are well.  Your videos are packaged Zen.Hey ToT, the Midge welder is more properly called a Grandma (GMA) welder since MIG is an acronym for (M)etal (I)nert (G)as.  And since most steel welding is with a mix of inert and active gases, Gas Metal Arc is more accurate. Happy one million.  Glad I put you over the top.  A tour of the garage would be OK, but just send me the money you promised and we're square.You know, it felt like something was missing in my subscriptions in the last 7 month but, luckily AVE  filled it with an hour long fire talk. Glad to see you back.Absolutely brilliant an hilarious as always. Welcome back!This is the most anticipated comeback since Rocky IV. Great to have you back TOT we have missed you. You’ll be pleased to know the differences between metric and imperial still hasn’t changed.Love to see how you set up the adapter brazed to the clamping head.They make the pendulum things pointy at one end so you can hammer them into the brown cellulose foam material that trees are mad of for windy days. Just thought I would mention it. Good to see you back at itNice to see you back Tony, I  was getting cranky without you.Glad to see you're alive sir. Incase you're curious you have been missed.The end of this video was so clever. Thanks for the work you do to amuse me TOT!HES BACK IM SO EXCITED
In all seriousness can’t wait to see what the months and years to come will bring! Can’t wait to learn some interesting tips along the way!Clickspring would lay out a beautifully aesthetic bumper spike, rough it out with a bandsaw then carefully file it down by hand before engraving, polishing, and bluing it 😁So glad to see my favorite maker video guy back on the interwebs. Thanks!Good to have you back old Man. We've missed you.flippin laughing actually out loud. what a legendCongrats on a million subscribers :) you deserve itOMG, I was afraid this show had been cancelled!

My family loves watching your videos.I just gasped on a conference call when I saw a new TOT video was available. DREAMS DO COME TRUE! Glad you're back, I was actually worried.Bravo, Tony - So good to have you back!A new TOT video this days are like finding a lost unopened christmas present in the middle of april :-)I forgot how good these videos are.  Glad you’re back.Great to see you back! Without new videos I had to go back over your old vids to find the point where you found your sense of humour!I've missed you tony <3 I'm always more than fine with people taking time off however long it may be, I'd rather my favourite content creators be settled/happier with their AFK life than force themselves to release content, thanks for making videos though they are always entertaining.So glad to see you back! Hope you are all doing well.So glad to have you back!  Definitely missed your videos!  Hope you're doing well!Welcome back!

I knew your return was going to light up this corner of the internet, and you didn't disappoint.I missed you mate! Very happy you are back!!! Thanks for the laughs!This has to be the most well hidden Subscribe joke you've ever done by the way. Well played.Make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any Premier League highlights uploads ► http://bit.ly/SSFootballSub 👍I can’t believe the performance kova just had the fact that no rivals talk about him has always been crazy in my eyes he’s phenomenalRudiger remains the only player who managed to score against Tuchel ChelseaYou know 2021 is weird when Werner scores and kepa keeps a clean sheetI like how no one is going to talk about Giroud. Underrated legend..As a Chelsea fan it’s so good to see Werner smilingI feel like a proud dad watching kepa and werner actually achieving thingsWerner really deserved that goal! Will give him so much confidence 💙I really love the constant support and backing Timo gets all of us (Chelsea fans) want and love seeing him smilingBro the goosebumps you get as a Chelsea fan watching all the boys be so happy for Werner after the assist & goal and after the game😍💙Kepa kept a clean sheet and Werner actually scored. What a weird match 😂😂The first 2 mins of this highlight was just werner. Was so influential and 100% deserved a goal💯Werner really deserved that. He has been playing well creating key chances, making runs, getting assists and winning penalties. Determined to prove hes not a flopHope this brings his confidence backCan we just appreciate the effort that Kepa put in great performance by him and the blues today 💙💙💙💪🏻Werner is a class act. He was fantastic in Germany with so much skill. He’ll show what he can do now with the confidence that goal brings.Look how happy azplicueta was when werner scored now thats a captainYo I’m an Arsenal fan but my respect. I’ll always like Chelsea whether we’re rivals or not. And I’m so happy for Werner finally the mans bagged one in 😂😂💯💯That goal and performance will really boost Werner’s confidenceGuys this game was a miracle
Werner scoring
And
Kepa keeping a clean sheet.I’m not even a Chelsea fan but I have to say Werner deserves that, he has kept working and trying so hard of late unlike previous Chelsea big money strikers; his runs of the ball and penalty winning has been class off late so that goal is the cherry on top. So happy for him and Hopefully he can kick on further now.Werner is the signing of the summer. Pure classI feel proud to be a Chelsea fan after our performance tonight.Another class performance from Kovacic. Criminally underratedTIMO IS BACK!!! I feel for him, i really do. Nice to see him finally get his goal. This might boost his confidence.I'm so happy to see Timo smiling 🤩You know you’re in a different universe when Werner scores a goalwerner is so crucial to the attack, tuchel has brought back his confidence 🙌I love that Werner scores has to be in the titleWhen you realise Tuchel has taken Chelsea from 9th to 4th in 4 games..he always seems like a player with a  good work rate and puts a shift in even when hes not scoringWerner’s goal was so emotional 😢 and I’m a united fanSomething I like about Tuchel is he hasn’t been choosing his players based on form/reputation/price tag, he’s been choosing from the people he’s worked with who’ve bought into what he wants from the team. Never thought I’d see Alonso, Kepa, Rudiger and Christensen play for Chelsea again, even Hudson-Odoi to some extent. I definitely think there’s more telling matches to come, and I don’t think we’ll see the true Tuchel Chelsea until maybe the start of next season, but I like the way he’s headed.Werner was incredible this gameKovacic absolutely immense, what a playerWerner scoring this match is the best moment this season.Loving the way Tuchel is getting this to team to play..

But do we agree Chelsea missed Mount in the 2nd half?How much difference a positive energy makes. The Chelsea squad looks reignited since TT arrival. He is a beacon of a light!Werner scored a goal. I thought that I would never see the day.I’m not a chelsea fan but it’s nice to see Werner score in the prem again, just hope I don’t see loads of chelsea fans overhype thisEveryone is so suprised that werner scored but if you’ve been watching him recently under tuchel he’s been amazing and a goal has been coming but it’s not even just that timo offers so much always making runs and assisting, and he did start the season well got 2 against Southampton he just had a blip every striker goes through themYesss a great performance by Chelsea, Kepa keeping a clean sheet, Timo scoring and assisting, Giroud scoring, motm has to go to either Timo, Kovacic or Kepa but for me its Timo, COYB💙💙💙💙Kepa performing knowing all the media attentions now on Alisson and not himWerner has honestly improved so muchHe scored it’s a miracle !!Putting my neck out but I think Werner might be able to salvage this season to something dignifyingI don’t understand why Timo Werner is not appreciated.

The Guy is an incredible striker but certain times: there are always mistakes that happen especially with all footballers....... a Great Goal to get back in formFinally... Hope Timo keeps scoringPeople who are saying “OoOo the world ends werner scored” grow up you know he’s a class player kepa put in a good performance and it was just an all-round brilliant performanceWerner goal was well deserved! mans a Chelsea legend in the makingHopefully Werner is back. He is class and can be a World-Class strikerFair play to Tuchel
He must be doing something right if even Werner scored 😳
Even the goal he *actually* scored didn’t wanna go in lolKovacic Is so underrated, what a performance from that guy today 🙌🏻Happy for Kepa, I’m sure it’s been a difficult few months for him mentally so getting a clean sheet should give him some confidence.Timo finally scored 😂Even though I'm not a Chelsea fan, I'm glad Werner is starting to settle at Chelsea. He played well todayWhen Timo got an assist and won a penalty last game we knew there was going to be a bounce backThat Werner goal tho🥶🥶😂😂Werner goal was deserved rly happy for himHe’s received some stick but can we just appreciate that kepa was given a chance to start in the league tonight

And not only did he keep a clean sheet 
But I thought he made some good saves tonightIf Timo Werner played for Man Utd. he would be called a prolific goal scorer.The way Rudiger rolls his eyes when Werner scores he's like thank god for that.Good to see Werner getting a goalHang on did I read the title right.

WERNER SCORED! MIND BLOWN 🤯😂This is the best Match of the season. Kepa kept a clean sheet and Werner scored in the same match.No one talking about werners salute in the thumbnail 😭😭Werner's goal had to be one that just crept over the line. Not even the glory of hitting the net.This will give Werner some confidence to score more goalsHopefully this brings his confidence up and he’d be back to “ITS TIMO TIME”Chelsea back in the mix for CL football. Tuchel brought in something  to the teamTwo miracles happened: Werner scored and Kepa made a save.Finally the lad has scored his first his a very exciting player to watch now hopefully he'll get his second in 8 monthsEven the goal Werner scored didn’t technically touch the net 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣*KEPA DID AMAZING TODAY SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW KEEP IT UP LADS💙💙⚽️⚽️*Werner needed that confidence boostI'm in shock did Timo verner score a goal this match was crazy Timo scored and kepa kept a clean cheetTimo scoring but more importantly Kepa keeping a clean sheet, great for his confidence we bought him for 70 mil for a reason so let’s hope he can get back to his better ways! Atletico coming up soon so we need a confident and in form squad 💙Iv never been so happy for a striker to scoreOmg Werner actually scored a goalIt's great play😁😁 by Timo Werner😊👍👍👍5 goals 8 assists...

Not bad for an out of form player getting used to a new team system in the best league in the world.

He will do bits in the seasons to comeWerner gets SO MANY CHANCES. If he was even half as clinical as Harry Kane, the world of football would fear him.genuinely happy for werner, and i don’t even support chelseaThis is gonna boost Werner’s confidence up!Tuchel is so good that he can even teach Kepa how to get a clean sheet and teach Werner how to scoreKepa playing well and turbo time scoring 🔥💙now werner has scored, as a liverpool fan i am shook he's going to light up the league under tuchelDo we ignore how easy his goal was but also the amount of sitters he shambledWerner actually shouldve scored a hat-trick but oh well, at least hes scored.I’m so excited to see city vs Chelsea in the future now, 2 teams in amazing form defensively but city better offensivelyEveryone: talking about werners goal
Kepas clean sheet: am i a joke to you.Congrats Werner, you finally scoredRudigers eye roll had me dying 😂Now watch Werner rob the golden boot out of nowherePleased for him, bet he scores loads now. LUFC.Buzzing for timo😍The key to getting Werner to score is to wack him in the face! 💀😅Werner acting like messi gets hurt and then suddenly with full of anger starts playing brilliantlyWow what a goal from Werner 🔥🔥🔥For the first time in forever Timo Werner finally scoredWerner is reminding me of Shevchenko and Fernando Torres.Everyone hyping up Werner , but he did still have 3 chances and only score one tap inIt is good to see werner back in form from a leeds fanIf Werner capitalises on all the chances he gets, we have a serious weapon in our hands. Tuchel needs to find a way to fit these 4 players now: Zyiech, Havertz, Chilwell and Pulisic. May be too much to ask but I believe these players are class and will thrive sooner or later.Everyone's like "werner is back to his best"

He scored a two yard tap-in against newcastleOmg time Werner has scored I swear you’ll never see anything like it again do not scratch your eyes you are really seeing this😂😂It’s good to see Timo Werner score again finally ended his goal droughtPedro Neto - 5 Goals 4 assists in 24 games
Timo Werner - 5 Goals 5 assists in 23 games
And but why do people say Pedro Neto is a baller but Timo Werner is a flopDid anyone notice Girouds handball in the build up to Werners goal 1.50?  That would be savage VAR taking that goal away from him.I swear there hasn’t been a game where Werner has scored where he hasn’t missed at last 3 other big chancesWerner actually had some gameGlad Werner finally scored although had he missed his confidence would be finishedEveryone knows that the Coach is trying all his best to help werner even though he missed more than the stars in the sky, and i can see how Tuchel is enjoying to destroy ZIYACH.Kepa keeping a clean sheet and Werner scoring I need to pinch my selfI’m a Spurs fan but I’m happy that Werner scoredAm I dreaming or did Werner really score?Never believed in new manager bounce until i saw werner score and kepa make a save in the same match 😳This guy has just been really unlucky has great movement and speedAs a Chelsea fan I don’t think that’s the goal timo needed for his confidence, still missing the chances he should be scoringSky really put a ‼️ at the end of the title like the biggest surprise was werner scoring 😂😂😂Those of you saying Timo scored, you forgot that  part of coaching is to motivate, and create match strategies that can make your player performs at higher  levels.  The boy lost confidence, coming another league and another environment different from what he used to played,but our lampard was never a football coach.  That is why I suggested to him, to commence his coaching career proper from league one. Chelsea fc would have been up there, if we have started the season with a proper football coach who can read games , and make substitutions without unnecessary sentiments. Good luck!Rare footage of werner scoring a goalWerner is still young his just having a Torres moment but werner has more belief and faith his gonna be a BEAST in due timing baring in mind his a BEAST already 🎯Well done Werner, Finally!Wow Werner actually scoredFirst Anders losing, then Werner scoring. What next, Arsenal making top 4?Good result but should've been more comfortable, we need to be more clinical a better side could punish us. Also feel like var didn't do its job again tonight. Chelsea should've had 2 penaltiesAnyone else thought Werner looked surprised when he scored?Tuchel did literally say that all Werner needed was a scrappy goal🤷‍♂️🔥If Werner had the finishing of say, Kane, he may actually be the top scorer. His movement is really goodEven when Werner does score his first goal it’s awkward af😂😂😂Kepa and Werner playing well? Thought I'd never see itWerner finally getting his rewardAs a Barnsley fan Chelsea had more chances against Newcastle than our squad what cost 8 million just proves we did a right job with our pressingCmon you blues back in the top 4 👊 and Werner back amongst the goalsWerner is like Shevenko when he played for usKovacic is such an underrated ballerWerner cuts his lip then assists giroud and Then bags a goal the lucky cut lipPlaying against Newcastle United is the football equivalent to having a pick up fight in boxing this seasonI love how they had to put “Werner scores” in the title, because they know it’s a strange occurrenceWhen you score so rarely that just the fact you manage to scoret deserves to be the video titleThank HEAVENS Timo scored AND a Kepa clean sheet. There is hope again...Werner didn't stop he pushed through bad form by playing for the team top professional1:38 the look from rüdiger says it allMy goodness, the amount of chances Werner spurned........Well done werner for finally scoring and asistingTook him long enough to break the droughtI think tuchel could get this team back on track 👏👏👏Werner scoring is a real life glitch 😉And here I was thinking Werner wouldn’t score in a brothelWerner scored for Chelsea. Never thought id say that2021 has been a crazy year so farWerner scored wowHe finally scored, but he nearly bottled it 🤣🤣way to go ChelseaTimo slowly coming back... 
Kepa slowly becoming number1 again... 
Marcos Alonso the main man on the left... 
Lamps is now gone... 
Like the Joker said, "its all part of the plan"Werner has such a terrible goals to good chances ratio. Edit: Wow, he had to score an absolute sitter. He's missed like 10 of those this seasonGreat bicycle kick goal by wernerWerner easily the best striker in the prem I mean have you seen his goal scoring form?Why do people act like Timo Werner isn't a dangerous player who makes a big impact on a lot of games but has struggled with decision making and finishing so far in the Prem while pretty much all other forwards for Chelsea did no better than him, but given time under a new manager in a better system and with some confidence he will likely improve into a very good player.Bout time timo 👏👏👏Wow. Werner finally scored and kepa played decentWhen 2021 is really weird but you realise Timo Werner has scored a goal and Kepa kept a clean sheetGiroud always shoots like he’s salt bae. Look at the stylish finesse on that shotWerner scores and Kepa keeps a clean sheet... I think 2021 is going to be another crazy yearImagine if Darlow saved that Werner goal lol. But well done chelsea for beating newcastleFinally my man scoredI said I felt bad for timo and wanted him to score but not against us ffsI love Werner start scoring againGive Werner Goal of the month award just for scoring a goal in a month.What a bicycle kick 😂😂😂Werner scoring and kept keeping a clean sheet in the same match 🧐The next 5 games will show how far we have comeAt least my boy Tuchel is getting paid for doing stuff, whereas Lampard was getting paid for sitting down and being absolute Bs, thanks Chelsea for doing something right.I feel like Werner is the new benteke and when he scores we are all in dibeleifHope this gives timo confidence to win the golden boot nowAm I the only one noticing that Werner missed a sitter and another relatively big chance, he wasn't really on the stretch for the first one, just didn't hit it with any intent.What five chances Warner scored I gotta see thisTuchel already doing a fantastic jobIf Timo's arm was raised a little higher in the thumbnail... Oh my...Why is no one taking about christensen's amazing pass to TimoWalk over Chelsea could have had a hat full of goals 😂2:17 Kepa actually makes a save for onceI miss zouma bro he is our second best defender after silva I don't know what is wrong with tuchelI don’t know what is more weird Werner scoring or kepa keeping a clean sheetWerner scores after Kepa comes back in. Coincidence? I think notI know Werner scores but after watching these highlights let’s be honest...
He should’ve got a hatrickHe strikes the ball really oddly, very low power typically, he needs to get some more power behind his shots.I know Werner scored but how can he keep missing big chancesNot a chelsea fan but happy Werner could end his goal droughtWerner tried to miss that one tooAt this stage Tuchel is 4 points behind "title contenders" United, as United struggle to hold on to 2nd...I love how they say Werner scoredKovacic really has 99 dribbling but 40 shootingHow did Werner not get bonus in fantasyGlad he scored but could of had a hatrick tonightanyone not surprised that the goal werner scores is a tap inKepa keeping a clean sheet and Werner scoring? YOU'VE MESSED WITH THE NATURAL ORDER!Werner missed 2 easy chances but because he scored a tap in nobody will talk about itIt’s called “wish” because you wish you got the thing you orderedYou are awesome Austin - I love your team and hi Ken, hope you remember me :)I love how this always starts out “weird things from Wish!” Or “mystery tech” and turns into “grown men playing with toys”.Timothy is definitely a wish employee who really needs a raiseThe sight of a grown man wearing a dinosaur costume and trying to fight a toy lowkey made my day.I work at Amazon and used to work in the warehouse removals department...we used to destroy fake pokemon cards every day! The amazing amount of bootleg we would run into was amazing.Nice shirt bro ahahaha - LSI love how Austin actually reacts with his co-workers and editor's. If only most people would actually make bonds like austinGood to see a youtube channel actually acknowledge that they get their money back from most purchases by making videos on them.

Can't tell you how many times I see well off YouTubers complain for half a video about how they paid as little as $2 for crappy game or something.These videos are super useful, bruh..  You are taking one for the collective team, and we appreciate it...plus it doesn't hurt to have a laugh at some of this crap, lol.I don't know wether to be upset that Wish is scamming people or impressed they manage to find a convincing knock offs to sell, most of the time.Austin: Spends literally $1100 on a ps5
also Austin: oh i forgot about thatOnce, my uncle bought a futuristic cool mask on wish. When he got the mask, it was a piece of plastic.Seeing Austin fool around in a t rex costume is actually the height of entertainmentI was honestly expecting a bootleg PS5, but the people who send you those rocks were so grateful, that they thought "We can't send this man, a bootleg. Let's send him something better." and so, they send Austin those rocks. Those are some beautiful rocks, dude. Totally worth the 1,100 dollars that you spent on them. 😆😆Man I laughed so hard at your reaction to that motherboard purchase I watched it a few times.. too funnyI love how he spent 1100 bucks then laughed his ass off21:30 is when what you clicked for, begins.Everyone with their boss: getting anxious and being careful what they say infront of him/her.

Austin's employees: makes him wear a t rex outfit and saying he's balding.Seeing Austin happy always makes me happy anyone else?Ken: “There shoulda been five”
I can’t stop laughingIdk who invented the t-rex costume, but I have had so many good times watching those suits on all types of videos, that person deserves a nobel prize... 🤣🤣who even thought it was a great idea to make Wish lol.I've never seen someone so happy after spending money on nothingI would pay more then the actual cards for these if I got them from Austin.I worked for wish as a CSR, around 2016 - 2019. around 2017 they still have a product moderator that actually checks for these scummy postings by merchants. However, suddenly Wish decided to remove the moderating team and that is the time when the behavior of the merchants started to get worsen. However, back then merchants will not get their money not until the user confirmed his/her purchase has been delivered. However, not all of the users actually spend time dealing with customer service, and these asshole merchants getaways from some of this scam. I really think Wish is a sinking ship and I am surprised that they are still in the business. People stop buying shit at Wish you won't get any decent value out of any tech that you would find on their website. But the clothes and other things you could get lucky, but not with tech. It's a no-no.Great use of resource. Nice to see these products can be made cheap.Wish : Scams Austin
Austin: Scams Viewer
Viewers : MORE!"Ken, you should know how to find the HOLE by now"
                           -Austin Evans 2021I’d love to see Austin order from Wish completely drunkThese guys are hilarious! Love this channel 🥳Imagine being able to afford even the wish verison of the ps5Thank you Austin on showing us what  not to buy when shopping on wish even if I had 1.1k for a ps5 it will not be from wish/online.“Something hard, just the way I like it.” Me too Austin, me too.I was expecting a crappy console looking like a ps5.. But not freaking rocks 😂Austin you should do a show that you spend the day or week with nothing but Wish products this should include your team as well I mean the products are so well made.It took them a month for it to ship their stuff, and only minutes for me to forget what they boughtI would love to see Austin unpack an entire booster box of bootleg Pokémon cards!Oh wow! That sound quality of the PSRock was topnotched! I should put that on my must buy listAustin running around as a inflatable dinosaur was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.I like how he's just wearing an LTT shirt.hey austin, i really enjoy your videos. keep up 👍❤️Its tranding. But I really miss the vanilla Austin Evans, the journey that took him to reach this point. I still go back & watch older videos, specially the Nintendo consoles reviews. Those were surreal & very well explained.Ive seen Austin act like a kid on numerous occasions, but this one takes the cake!! Nice lolI'm now sure that Austin is addicted to WASTING his money.Can you imagine what would happen if all the time and resources dedicated to designing and creating Wish objects were redirected toward creating real and good tech or other kind of things ? They would have at least 50% less stuff to sell, but it would be GREAT stuff :P23 minutes of Austin trying to not regret his life.Austin: hating a microcenter employee because he has a piece of LINUS TECH TIPS merchandise
Also austin: standing in full shot witha Linus tech tips shirtI think it's unfair to call wish a retailer, since there are thousands of sellers on wish.. 
And I have to say, that I've got some good OEM goods from wish, like batteries that I've tested and still using 1/3 of the cost else where and not to forget about the toll free import handling..Now this is what I call quality contentYou are singlehandedly keeping Wish aliveSeeing Austin on a Dinosaur costume is the best thing I've seen in a long timeWhere would we be without this content in times like these 🙏Also having another leeway of getting an extra amount of their money's worth from refunds could be a good thing to add in too
Especially in extreme bulk amounts...Honestly Ngl seeing Austin in that amazing dinosaur costume made me forget all my problems and just made me laughI bought the X12 and hacked it to play US ROMs. It works pretty good. I didn't pay $50 for it, I maybe spent $27 after shipping.Morale of the story: don’t order stuff on wish, otherwise you will get bootleg products.Great PS5 review I’m def buying now. Thanks Austin!“That print is not real” Me who has the original card with that print: :’(Austin is keeping wish relevant.I never laughed so hard in my life watching Austin in that dinosaur suitOne problem about the fake vita emulator thing is that it emulates WAY too fast.I don’t understand how nobody has taken down wishI just found this channel and I love it! You all are great!!I wonder how it feels to work for Austin 😅There are so many unforgettable items in this video that I forgot what i just watched. Needless to say, I still enjoyed it. Good job"Something hard, just how I like it."

                         -Austin, 2021“I should find quality items to give you and entertaining few minutes...I should not spend a lot of money... and cry afterwards”
Austin, bubby, the crying afterwards IS the entertaining few minutes!Man I just love your wishtery tech episodesThis complete episode is hilarious!  😂I swear wish could make something more expensive just to avoid selling something realSomeone finally made a ps5 wish video. We all knew it was coming. Respect.Okay, as a Chinese I think I can explain what they mean by “love car” it was clearly machine translation and in China we like to call our cars as  ‘爱车’ (爱=love 车=car) it’s just a way we like to express how much we value our stuff I guess“Patrick thats a router.”
“Whats the difference?”The final and last time Austin buys fake Pokémon cards 😂😂He finally continued a trend by Ken of ordering costumes like mystery techs and "wishtery" techs😁This is the kind of quality content I pay for YouTube premium for.Austin is such a child and I love itAustin: I got scammed on Wish.

Yes Austin, the floor is made of floor, you die when you are killed, and every 60 seconds, a minute passes.That PS5 sure had rock solid performance"Something hard, just the way I like it". Words of wisdom by Austin EvansI love that Austin makes fun of wishWish: Whats your wish sir?
Man: I want Ray Ban Glasses, but real ones from Italy.
Wish: Your wish will come true
*look at glasses and read "Made in China"We need an entire channel of austin reviewing tech with the dinosaur costumeI had got fake pokemon cards from a family member once that had 10x the normal health. So when it's supposed to be 30, it would be 300. It was hilarious.I would have been really surprised if the rocks actually came in the PS5 packaging.6:25  THIS....IS why you're my go-to tech channel above all others! This is why I subscribed with the bell!I wish i could spend all the money for a gpu that austin is currently spending on wish : ("Ooh, that sounds like a good deal. Add to cart."
Basically why 90% of wishtery tech items are bought.My favorite part is the wish ad.
You guys are awesome!!!I felt scammed even though it wasn’t my money. Still entertaining but this is just wild.Ken is a mood .. I aspire to be as petty as him one dayWe all know why it's called Wish. It's because we *WISH* we could get exactly what we ordered.the roboraptor story arc in the mystery tech videos has been one of the best things in recent history.I thoroughly enjoyed your dinosaur segment. I was in tears.22:24
This reminds me of that one time where someone got an aftermarket "500 GB HDD" which turned out to be a 1 GB flash drive with two nuts inside a hard drive case.

BUYER BEWARE!!!"There is something hard just the way I like it" - sounded very double meaning 😀😀😀I honestly dont know how wish got to this. Back in 2016 when hoverboards were just getting popular, and at the same time they were exploding, I had already ordered one from wish for $200. At the same they were like $1000 or $800. I was also 12 and about to turn 13 so it didn’t seem sketchy at the time. When I got it, it was exactly what I ordered. Nothing was wrong with it and it worked well. I still have it and it never broke. Even my stupid sister couldn’t brake it when she jumped off of it with it rolling and crashing into shit. Also my friend who fell off it a few times. It showed no signs of damage.His reaction to the phone was way to goodYou guys should have hooked that mini speaker up to the mojo amp and cranked it!!there was a time when austin was informative ! that time is not now ! this is now a kids show !I’ve been seeing Austin more than my friendsThat Pokémon card look so much better than original :o I wonder why how come Nintendo haven't thought about that instead of put all white on the bottomLeave it to logic, to make great entertaining and informative videos😎I haven’t laughed this hard in a while 😂What's sad is people who use Wish unironically.I was going to complain about the 5 ads spots on a 23 minute video, but then I guess Austin needs the money after wasting so much every Mystery Tech.Love Asmongold’s new contentThese videos are so good keep up the work 👍😌One day wish will sponsor Austin due to him being a great customer at wish. ComI love how he buys a PS5 instead of a Xbox 😂 that’s how you know PS5 is the best oneI LOVE THE SHIRT! It's so nice to see a Techie Youtuber supporting another fellow Youtuber! :3I dident know you could play music on the ps5... rock and roll sounds so good on it. It rocks 😂😂😂I was going to get that handheld just to run emulators on as I thought it run off android. 

I use my p30 to run my emulators but gets hot and wanted something separate from my phone. 

You saved me £60 thankswhoever threw that first package at austin, thank u🤣It was worth watching this video just to see you get in that dyno costum...im also kinda jealous that you got your switch for 36 dollars..Seeing the seal of the PS5 I immediately heard DankPods screaming "Someone's been here!"That ps5 was amazing! My limestone one runs pretty well thoVR headsets are actually not using OLED anymore because its pixel arrangement leads to a more visible screen door effectNot only was it a scam they put rocks in the box and didn’t even try to make it seem legitI think Ken sometimes forgets who his boss isTruly disgust that some “people” would do this horrible thing.Plot Twist: he never bought a PS5 on wish and used a box he already had and filled it with rocksNow this is some quality contentI wish I had enough money to buy fake things on InternetI think wish makes more money off of content creators than other shoppersif i spent 1100 dollars and got 3 rocks i would of been severely pissed lolThe dinosaur part is amazing, very well edited and possibly not scriptedThe Blastoise art on the fake Pokemon card was real and it was featured in a collection box a few years ago.when austin was puting on and wearing the dino costum i was laughing so hardIf you ever feel dumb, just remember that a man spent 1k on 3 rocks11:45 You ordered these! Instantly shames austin by slamming the cards on the deskone word PC i have never been more happy. i prey for you PS guys.Buy an RTX in wish :PThe whole segment with the Dino suit is GOLDI legitimately feel bad for that guy who ordered that “ps5” on wish.Hearing Ken say "I got us a refund" and I was so surprised. WowI have a caterpie EX too, I got it from a garage sale years ago and thought it would be a valuable misprint or something lol21:32 is the ps5 you welcomeWho else was dying from laughter when austin was in the dinosaur suit! Lol!!! Great vid guys.Linus drops tech Austin drop dollars. All I can say is Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock1:57 "that's what you use to get a ps5 at a store"😂you guys are just awesome! <3"You should know how to find the hole, im starting to feel things"$1100 for a Series X with "express shipping" that takes about a year :^)
What, do they need to mine and refine all the materials by hand before it before shipping it off or something?Ah so this is how Austin spends his money on wish.
I think Ken does a better job XDFinally a costume segment that was funny! Preety coolClicks for the PS5
*Sees Austin in a giant inflatable dinosaur costume*

“Alright, Imma head out”When austin says the art ain’t real on them cards, it hurts. he hasn’t been collecting for a bit. But to be fair, he’s mostly a tech channel and not a card opening channel lol22:55 had me laughing so hard“Sony PlayStation rock!”  Cracked me up😂😂Dang it I want a Sony PlayStation rock that looks like the best console ever. How much you selling it for lol 😂I love watching this channel because my phone is pretty big so when I watch YouTube videos I have to zoom in to get full screen and it fits off most of the screen. And when it's not zoomed in there's black bars on the sides. But when I watch your channel that doesn't happen. It's full with no black bars or nothing cut off. So i just wanted to say, thanks!Seeing Austin put on a Dinosaur costume made clicking on this video worth itThe best part of this video was getting an ad for an electric car RIGHT after he says drive electric cars. 🤣Frankie Muniz became a pretty legit tech reviewer!!Your Dino suit made it all worth it 😂🤙🏽Well done guyz!!! Gave me a giggle ;)what the hell. i used to watch your videos on youtube so long ago. Probably nearly a decade ago. never really watch youtube anymore until recently when i started building a computer. im glad youre doing well at nearly 5M subs. thats hard work. fuck yeahMan should’ve said the ps5 never came when he got all the other packages,he made us watch something that we didn’t exspect toIts so fun when everyone in the studio gets in the videoNo one : 

Absolutely no one: 

Austin: I’m going to buy a ps5 of of wish 👍Austin should have gotten a monke costume and and made a happy monke circles with his friendsThis was actually a lesson that Kageyama and Hinata learned after losing to Aoba Johsai; speed can make you predictable.What really made me smile this episode is that TSUKKI of all people actually chased the damn ball.Daichi knew Tsukishima was tired, but if Tsuki hadn't dove for the ball and given it a little more air-time, Daichi probably wouldn't have gotten to it in time. Tsuki really outgrew his "It's just a club" mindsetSo is no one gonna talk about Daichi's dig, like, that was amazinghonestly the voice acting is MASSIVELY underrated in this sceneAtsumu voice actor been going crazy this whole season, the ups and downs he does with his voice and this scene right here was amazing. hearing him narrate it made it so rewatchable for meI liked how they ended it with a block instead of a spike, so satisfying to see them block the twins!"This position, this timing, this angle".

Kageyama used these exact words when he first set the attack for Hinata. I love the parallels that Haikyuu is drawing. First of all, against Aoba Johsai, the first time, they essentially "won the battle but lost the war" - Kageyama successfully predicted that Iwaizumi was going to get the set from Oikawa, and they won the second set, but Kageyama became predictable himself when he set to Hinata and was blocked. This moment echoes that because Atsumu, wanting the point desperately, wished to use the speed of his quick with Atsumu to score...but in turn was blocked by Kageyama and Hinata, the only two that could react in time to a spike they were so familiar with. Speed is a weapon, but also a curse. People like Nekoma's Inuoka, and even Tsukishima back when the twins first copied it could shut it down because they had time to adapt to it.

This match overall was so epic!1:57 , this scene was amazing, not because of the block which in itself was amazing, but because if you look closely you can see that Kageyama positioned his hand slightly behind Hinata's to provide support for him to stop the quick and so that it doesn't fly off towards the right. The masters of the insane quick were both thinking the same thing and they knew that it was coming and exactly how to block it. 11/10 episodeWhat's weird is the part that made me choke the most was the guy slamming the desk at 1:15 yelling "Go back! Go back!..Hurry!"I've watched this so many times, and it's only now occurring to me that "we don't need the memories" though it's a motto intended to inspire, functions as a representation of their downfall and why Karasuno won. Because Karasuno DOES remember. They remembered how it felt to lose to Aoba Johsai doing the same thing the twins did. They won because they had the memories.Remember when-
Hinata couldn't receive and spiked with his eyes closed.
Kageyama was struggling to be a "team player".
Tsukishima didn't really wanna do anything.
Yamaguchi wasn't a confident pinch server.
*Like the first years' development is insane.*When atsumu said "This timing, this angle, this speed it's perfect" it was the same lines that Kageyama said In their first match againts Aoba johsai when they got blocked and lost, this is exactly what happened, the brothers got blocked, and lost. HAIKYU EP24 IS A 10/10The fact that the winning point was made from a hinata/kageyama BLOCK was incredible writing. The characters showed how far they’ve come just in this last rally alone 😭God, this scene is actual perfection. It shows all of the growth throughout the show. The synchronized attack, an attack where everyone works together and just trusts that the ball is going to them, and Tanaka being the one to spike it after being mentally torn down in this match. After it gets blocked, Tsukishima, Mr. It’s-just-a-club himself, is the one who chases the ball to the end of the court, tapping it just before it is able to fall to the ground. Then Daichi once again being the most reliable teammate, showing us he is the captain for a reason, getting the ball back onto the court. Then comes one of my favorite parts, where Yahaba hits the table yelling for them to go back, this doesn’t only show us that the rivals are rooting for them, but how memorable Karasuno has become, they were nothing, just clipped crows and barely remembered by the other teams, but now one of their biggest rivals are the ones rooting for them. THEN the twins quick, where they use Kageyama’s line from the first freak duo quick, but Kageyama and Hinata block it, the rival quick team is being blocked by the freak quick team. Kageyama, the one who rather do everything by himself and Hinata who only cares about spiking, working together to take down their own attack, GROWTH AMIRIGHT!! But that’s not all, we see the ball, reflected in Kita’s eyes, hitting the ground. Kita, the captain, who has only ever played in third year, the one trusted with every loose ball, his eyes are the ones we see Inarizaki’s defeat through. 

Sorry for rambling in some public comment section, I just feel a lot about this scene and felt some peace through maybe others seeing my thoughts1:51 Can we all appreciate that the music in this scene has the same leitmotif as the OST "Above" (plays when Hinata makes his declaration to defeat Ushiwaka) and "Battle of Concepts", the latter being same theme used in the final rally against Shiratorizawa. Yes, the "Twins Quick Minus Tempo Back" absolutely rules, yes the "This position...this timing...this angle" absolutely rules, yes the "We Don't Need The Memories" absolutely rules, yes the double Hinata and Kageyama block absolutely rules, yes Hinata and Kageyama clinching the win against Inarizaki in the exact same way Aoba Johsai defeated them (by blocking the quick) absolutely rules, but ALL OF THAT combined AND the music having that recurring leitmotif, it just, dare I say

PERFECTLet's not ignore how engaged Atsumu's voice actor was. The emotion in his voice... MAAAANNN!Can we all just appreciate Yahaba from Aoba Johsai YELLING to Karasuno to get back to their positions? The way past teams are rooting for our orange boys will always get me.I love how all of Karasuno’s old opponents are watching the match and  cheering them onAtsumu's "This position.. this timing.. this angel! Its perfection!" Still gives me chillsThe twin's quick in this episode is by far the coolest quick in the whole series no 🧢1:51 God the sound design is so clean there its amazing, and honestly when Osamu spikes it it sounds like a gunIt’s very quick, but around 1:21 and 1:22, you see both Hinata and Kageyama waiting at the net for the twins’ quick. I love things like that in this show!“Twins’ quick, Minus tempo! Back! This position, this timing, this angle.... It’s perfect” 😲 Am I the only who had goosebumps from that partThe “Go Back! Go Back!!!” hit me harder than expected.Kita wasn't able to play until he got to his third year, and then the reflection in his eyes, and the fact that they lost, it's so sadMan i really love to see Osamu's face in 1:53 He seems to be enjoying so much the quick play.Just saw this today, Hinata & Kageyama are officially top 5 anime duos, I never thought Haikyuu would surpass the Aoba Johsai match so much. 🔥 The immediate respect and hype for the twins in this moment too.. jeez.1:48 this moment was so beautiful. The music, the Miya Twins setting up Minus Tempo, and Inarizaki's Slogan being shown word-by-word into their spike was probably the most chilling and one of the most beautiful spikes of this show ever. One of the most beautiful scenes in all of anime as a matter of fact!I love the twins quick, and how much time it has, it feels built up almost like the twins were the hero, and they just made their new super move, and the juxtaposition to that being immediately beaten by the originators of the 'freak quick' just feels incredible, such a rush of emotionsAt the end of the episode where Tsukkishima was sort of praising Hinata and Kageyama, my heart was filled with so much joy (ToT)Can't stop watching. Miya Twins's voice actors killed itThis is by far one of the best seasons and by far the best episode out of this season that I’ve ever seen. Absolutely beautiful. I can’t wait for another season!Best part of this scene is that it’s exactly the same of how they lost to Oikawa in season 1. Minus tempo that gets blocked. I love it. Same exact words tobio uses right before they lose. “This position, this angle, it’s perfect”This has to be my favourite scene in all of the anime. Something about how the twins quick was done and how the game was decided by a block and not a spike just really stands out to me.Tsukki's character development is phenomenal. Even though he was talking about how fatigued he was throughout this episode he still ran for the ball and dove to save it. He wouldn’t have even considered if this were the first or 2nd season.This entire scene was just *chef's kiss* Goosebumps, tears, lost my breath. This was executed so lovely!!“This position, this timing, this angle. Itz perfect” ~Words before utter failure multiple timesThis anime has such a great feeling to it. Every episode I watch fills makes me happy and fill with me with joy. I love the character building, animation quality, and overall realism. This episode had me so hyped and made me feel like I was actually watching a real sports game. Watched it 3 times and this scene was amazing. Hope others are enjoying this anime as well because I finally gave it a chance before season 4 came out and I’m happy I didive watch this 100 times and it still gives me chills1:52 Can we just stop and appreciate the power Osamu put behind that serve? The sound it made was just ✨Can we just mention how badass the Miya’s quick was set up. The text in between, the light in the eyes, “We aren’t here for the memories” flashing across the screen, and for it to get blocked by the original quick duo... absolute perfectionIs it just me or... between a beautiful tag team pick-up by Tsukki and Daichi, exciting animations and voice acting, the whole squad simultaneously saying "sufficient distance achieved" while moving in perfect unison, the twins saying the name of their attack, and the beautifully executed poetry of Kageyama and Hinata blocking the twins' quick...  despite all of that badassery, Kita's eyes are what stole the show (made that moment) for me.No matter how many times I re-watch this, the thrill is always there! Haikyuu to the top was truly amazingI cried when hinata passed the ball, reassuring everyone on his team not to Rush 👁👄👁👌Inarizaki lost the same way karasuno lost against seijoh, their "invincible" quick getting blockedYuki Hayashi and Asami Tachibana sure know how to make you climb to the edge of your seats with music.I love the art style for this last section because it really shows the tenacity and the pressure and the need to win in everyone's eyes and makes things look frantic so you can't keep up with what's happeningThe way all their old opponents were watching and cheering them on
The way Tsukki praised Hinata and Kageyama at the end 
The way  Daichi and Tsukki did everything they could to get that ball up

My heart T_Tmy fave part of the entire rally is Tsukki actually diving for the ball 🥺 can’t wait for his development against NekomaThe fact tsuki one of the better characters is complementing the 2 ppl he envies the most and on top of that u would never think of tsuki to explain his emotions shows both tsukis development and on top of that what monsters shoyo and kageyama r and how how tsuki can acknowledge them

So good“WE DON’T NEED THE MEMORIES” part was so sick and that freaking spike was awesome🔥Idk if y’all notice this, but in the first season this is how they lost their first match. Tobio even said this position, this timing, this angle is perfect!!! and after they lost they were sitting on the ground, but this year they won playing defence and they were both on the ground. Basically showing how far they came. Beautifulyahaba and the rest of aoba johsai being passionate for karasuno is such a great depiction of morale and spirit in this show, ugh...this is perfectionI’m never gonna forget the goosebumps this episode gave me!This isn't your first time watching this and getting chills.I love the moment kageyama and hinata block their quick. Just like how their quick agaisnt Aoba Josai. Atsumu even says the same thing "This position! This timing! This angle! It's perfect!" Is exactly what Kageyama said in that rally too. Absolutely love it.Miya twins: minus tempo quick

Hinata and Kageyama: we’re going to pull what we call an Aoba Johsai moveI bet Hinata and Kageyama gonna argue on who’s point that wasThis position! This timing ! This angle! The whole season has been about Hinata and Kageyama elevating their game beyond their one weapon, and the fact that that culminates in victory over that very weapon is just so awesome. This is why dramatic irony is the most awesome force in fiction.I love how Kageyama and Hinata were the people to end it because they knew in that situation what the other team needed.I've both read this & watched this before, but Daichi showing up to return it just after Tsuki still shocks/surprises me lol. It's such a good moment.Kita looking at their loss and Tsukki's monologue is such a beautiful touch with so much emotional impact. What a top tier episode.Please tell me I wasn’t the only one who forgot to breathe throughout that entire rally🔥🥵I love coming back to watching this clip it made me so proud of Karasuno 🥺 they had come so far !Okay I’ve seen some good points but let’s all focus on something we missed 
The animation of that eye at the end always gets me as one of the players on the bench watches his dream get crushed that clear layer of tears forms in his eyeDude the voice actor for Miya Atsumu really did a amazing job, like it give me chills when he says the lines "This Position, This timing, This angle". I just keep replaying this scene, it's so awesome.This is one of the best scenes in haikyuu so farI like how they put EVERYTHING they had on that single scene of the ball falling reflected on kita's eyes. INSANEI love how they added "this timing" and "this position". It just makes the scene so much more nostalgic.I love the small detail that inarizaki was going all out, there was no reaction from the players on court, they were all so concentrated.

Love haikyuu, I want everyone to winWhen Miya Atsumu said “Minus tempo” the goose bumps were unbelievableThe one thing that always gets me is Tsukki’s dive to get the ball. Really shows the change of his characterThe way Atsumu just monologues their quick it’s just so....I’m not sure but it’s perfectionI've rewatched 1:16 50 times now, it gives me chills everytime, and the fact that even their enemies feel so passionate about this team makes this episode sooo goodI’m super happy that all the other teams that were shown were just super hyped and cheering for karasunoBest moment of season 4 🔥Notice when all of Karasuno starts running to get defend against an attack,  Hinata and Kageyama are already set up in a specific spot in the front. They used their experiences of relying heavily on their freak quick in the past to anticipate what the Miya Twins were going to attempt in this do or die moment. This scene was masterful 10/10La construcción sonora de esta escena es una belleza 100/10.Finally! A Karasuno win ending a defensive play. Like how Seijoh won against Karasuno at Interhigh0:53 anyone see daichi behind him? It’s impressive how tsukishima was basically falling, if you picture it irl he’s going pretty fast and then daichi comes out of nowhere as if he’s faster than lightat times like these, it feels like a win and a loss at the same timeWhat’s wild about the way they present these scenes is that, though inarizaki wouldn’t have won if they got that fast attack point, it sure as hell feels like they would have.The highlight of this episode for me was seeing Tsukki really put his all into this game. Tsukki, a player who only does enough put in his all and that made this episode that much greater... seeing the whole team play 100%. 10/10 episode!To be honest the craziest thing about this scene for me was seeing Tsukki dive for the ball, never seen him do that, it shows how far he's come as well.I started to cry from 1:15. That is phenomenal god tier voice acting, music, sound, and animation right there! Yahaba in that scene was all of us watching the final rallyI have watched this like 30 times and still get goosebumps 😭😭the way the twins are voiced here genuinely makes it sound like they’re going to get the pointCan we just- I don’t think I’ve ever seen Tsukki throw himself for a dig 🥺✨ and Daichi backed him up- and the last point was Hinata and Kageyama blocking 😭😭😭 this is such a pivotal point in the series that truly shows how Karasuno has grown 😭😭this is so beautifully done. the differing perspectives and how everyone slowly becomes the biggest karasuno fan ever. i still get chills watching the player slam his hand on the table watching with his teammates yelling for them to get back. amazing.The music the animation the emotion are all so perfect  personally this anime is in my top 3 I get shivers every time I watch even though ik what's going to happen just rewatching this  scene gets me so hypedI loved how all the teams they faced from Miyagi prefecture were rooting for them despite being enemies at one point 😭This music...this action...this voice acting...this anime...this.. this...IT'S PERFECTION!"I think everyone in the crowd was shocked. But we weren't. In this contest of speed where every where every tenth- no every one hundredth of a second counted. Like the speed of the new back row minus tempo attack those two. And only those two. Didn't blink. They didn't even flinch by a single hair. Speed is a very. Very powerful weapon, its alluring. And it looks really cool. But it isnt invincible. Those two know that better than anyone." - Tsukishima keican't wait for the new season to come out. I can already tell Karasuno vs Nekoma is gonna be a game to watchI can’t tell you how much adrenaline I had running through me this entire episode There’s so many thing I could talk about but my top 4 are: 1)Hinata hitting the ball high so his team could breath. That just tells you that Hinata in that moment was the only calm/chill one because the hit was on purpose he was only to be able to take a sec and look at his surroundings and make that decision. 2) Tuski and Daichi’s receive like that just self explanatory 3) That teamwork block of Kageyama and Hinata I just loved how it wasn’t just they both jumped and it hit one person’s hand and went back but they both touched it and threw it back. 4) Tsukki realizing that in that last second that Hinata and Kageyama were the only ones that weren’t fazed and had enough strength in them to block the twins. This is why I love HaikyuuBy far this has been one of my top favorite anime over the decades!U know they serious when they say the move.Its so insanely cool how they win with that block that caused them to lose to aoba johsai. It rlly shows that losing IS meaningful bc hinata and kageyama learned from that experience that their quick isnt invinciblecan we all take a moment of appreciation for Yuki Hayashi, composer of this masterpiece´s soundtrack? thank you, Mr. Hayashi. you truly are an artist and a living legend. I am very thankful to have witnessed your work in this life.The episode had me on the edge of my seat all the way throughI think one of the things I absolutely loved about the game against Inarizaki was how much support they were getting from their past plays. Those past teams living through Karasuno, pushing on the team that could and would get through.

The intensity, the development, the character AND characters, the amazing styles, the absolute CHILLS from this anime are what have made it an all time favorite.

(Unrelated, but that moment you forget you made a comment months ago, so you make another one about something else related and suddenly don't know what to do about double-commenting . . .)I just wanna say other than their great plays and saves for the ball, one of my favorite parts is when Yahaba banged his hand on the table and the expressions of the other teams watching Karasuno- showing how tense it really was watching them.Samu and Tsumu: Twin’s Quick... Minus Tempo... Back!

Kageyama and Hinata: Ultimate NO U!this rally as a whole really represented their development as volleyball players throughout the anime incredibly well. Hinata slowing the pace down with kunimi's beautiful receive, Kageyama setting to tanaka even tho he asked him not to do that, Tsukishima actually trying to reach that ball even tho he knew he wouldn't be able to set it back, Daichi being the most reliable player in the entire damn anime and HINATA AND KAGEYAMA BLOCKING THE TWIN'S RENDITION OF THEIR MINUS TEMPO ATTACK (was that was super well done and so so so fitting I literally lost my mind I could talk about how symbolic this one block is for days) absolutely insaneBefore I watched haikyuu I never knew a ball hitting the ground could be so emotional, it can make you feel either insanely happy or insanely sadThe wild look in everyone’s eyes makes this so intense, when I see kageyama setting for tanaka I get chillsThe last two that tried to get the ball were so adorable just watching them run for it🥺POV: you’ve replayed this video for the 10th timeThe twins quick attack is honestly so cool and I wish they did it more than twice where one got blocked. Really feels like he is just loading up a cannon"We don't need the memories" has to be one of the sickest team mottos out there.The subtle change in chorus when daichi saves the ball gives me the chills every timeI love how the foreshadowing from the first few episodes with the phrase "This position, this angle, this timing, Its perfect." gets linked back to this final rally.This will never stop giving me chillsThe fact that the Miya twins were doing the minus tempo quick and the ones that block it are Kageyama and Hinata bro.. 10/10At 2:06 you can really feel how exhausted they are through their running.  Great animation detailEven though I love Karasuno, I feel sad that players like Aran and Kita didn't get a second chance against ItachiyamaOne thing that isn’t talked about much was the amazing voice acting in this scene alone. The emotion they put allows the viewers to really feel the tension and desperation while keeping us on our toes. I truly believed that twin quick was going to work.I definitely still prefer the old art style, but despite that, this scene is perfect. The music is incredible, the voice acting is top-notch, and the animation still looks clean as hell despite the style change. And Kagehina blocking the twins quick was just the perfect way to end the rally.Aquí es donde uno se da cuenta el buen uso del presupuesto para un capítulo épico!!This animation, this soundtrack, this match...

IT'S PERFECT!am I the only one who thinks that animating Shigeru from seijoh hitting the table increased the drama on this escene over 9000... I totally felt identified with him at the moment of watching this esceneI wished this season had the same animation as its last 3 seasons. Other than that it was pretty godlyThe fact that Hinata's two defining moments in this match were a recieve and a block really show how far he's comeBro this ep gave me chills watching it 10/10 loves every minute of itI love how they show the other players who are still going up for the spike and starting their jumps, just furthering the idea that the twins were ahead of everyone else, and hinata and tobio new exactly what that meant.I swear Haikyuu is easily top contender for best sports anime of all timeI keep watching this epic scene over again but Hinata's face at the beginning kills me every single time.i feel like there isnt enough credit given to the voice actors in this show, they really do a fantastic jobKageyama and Hinata showing the twins who the real quick attackers are by quick defending their attack. Learning from their loss to then DO THIS!“Let’s take it easy”
it’s so simple and such a minor thing but it gets forgotten all the time
A first touch that’s nice and high
A first touch that allows his teammates to breathe againThat smile ‘Samu has as he’s spiking really does bring me joy (even if they lost)The way the other teams are rooting them on......when that one guy said "Go Back, Go Back, HURRY!!!".  As a volleyball player, there is no higher respect...…This Anime hits home more than any other anime I've ever watched....  Well done Haikyu.....This match has become my favorite in the series like it was so intense and greatLesson learned: If it's not your first time doing the freak-quick, don't say "This timing, this position, this angle..."
(Kageyama said the phrase the first time against Seijoh and got blocked as well, didn't say it the second time and got through, just something cool to share)that twins quick was so well animated. it was the first time I was like oh damn, so that's why the quick is so impressive. the way osamu hits the ball the split second it leaves his brother's handsThat final block was so mesmerising, reminds you not to forget who the OG quick belongs toothe world will never understand the tide of emotions I felt when I saw tsukki chasing that last ball...The goosebumps from this were unrealMan this Final Rally team is really good.Daichi’s dig was awesome.This show will go down as the best sports anime ever.Season 4 is the best season 100%. Karasuno's old rivals cheering them on, the first years' development, the OST. Everything about this season is amazing.Yahaba cheering for Karasuno, the block and the Miya twins’ final quick
And daichi’s save
And hinata’s recieves
THYE WERE ALL EPICThere’s a lot in just this rally that could easily get overlooked but I think just completely adds to the overall hype

Tsukishima actually lunged to pick that ball up. Especially with all his character development and pessimistic attitude he still dove to keep that ball up

When everyone’s scrambling back into position, Hinata’s already there. Granted that’s how the play turned out but I think it just again shows his growth and development. He read that play like he did with Aran’s spike and was there to block it. 

Overall this has genuinely become one of it not my favourite anime of all timeI love the banners in this series, they really incapsulate every single team perfectly, for inarizaki, it is "we dont need the memories" which matches beautifully with the twin's and the team's mindset that the past is the past and the only thing that matters is the present, hence the we dont need the past memories. It is just good writing.That final move of the miya twins was awesome and epic , the music , the seiyus ufffff, brilliant everything , i love the match against shiratorizawa but this match is betterGotta love how unlike most shows where big moments like these are typically filled with super jumps or crazy spikes, Haikyuu shows how the little things like learning to take your time or properly read the flow of the game can make a huge influence on the outcome without all the unrealistic flashy stuff. Even the last spike by the twins, which was insanely fast and awesome in its own right, got shut down because Kageyama and Hinata learned from their match against Aobai Josei that just because it’s cool doesn’t mean it’s going to payoff in the long-runThis Position..., This Timing..., This Angle..., IT'S PERFECTPerfection. And so fitting for Kageyama and Hinata duo to block that quick attack. Beautiful!! I did not expect that which makes it more specialIt’s truly a magical spectacle to see Hinata and Kageyama block a quick together.“This position. This timing. This angle.”

I was wondering why this sounded familiar. It’s the first thing Kageyama says right before he does his first ever minus tempo w/ Hinata in season 1.I love this scene so God damn much from tanaka's spike and expression when he's blocked like he didn't see it coming but now he's focused on the ball to kageyamas desperation to keep it up even after just setting to tsukki reaching as far as he can till the very end to daichi noticing tsukki was at his limit so he followed through and returned it. Anime misses that desperation a lot like it's cool to see goku throw hands endlessly but it's way more epic to see the stumbling and fatigue and coordination slowly deterioratingKita watching helplessly as the ball drops on their court... It's an emotion you can't describe. Your final year and it ends just like that, with you watching helplessly..."This positions, this timing, this angle..." has to be quote of the show.It's like they saved the animation budget just for this episode. Well done.This position...  This timing...  This angle... it's perfect... holy hell that game me flash back to season 1This season. I can’t say enough of how great it was. And I this I found a new top moment on the show since number one was the final rally against seijo1:50 "We don't need the memories"
 This part always hurts😢IM LITERALLY SO PROUD OF HINATA PLEASE SUGA ALMOST STARTED CRYNG BECAUSE OF HOW FAR HE HAS COME JDJKDJSKJDKK AND THEN KITA'S EYES- I HONESTLY HAVE NO WORDSTsuki has some amazing character growth in this episode my god I love this showThe animation in this scene really shows how desperate each team was to get that final point‼️All of them were exhausted but they didn’t lose that hope and determination. Haikyuu’s animation team really popped off🙌🏽The way they blocked the miya twins quick minus tempo attack....like that's just so amazing...and ngl I..I cried 😢God, I just can't wait to see the final arc animated. This match was great!The whole 2 minutes gave me chills as I watched this. It reminded me of season 2 when karasuno faced aoba joseiI really like the 1:15 scene for some reason, the emotion in Yahaba's voice is really coolLa música, el momento. Todo fue perfecto!!!!EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS WAS BEYOND PERFECT
THE BLOCK, TSUKKI DIVING FOR THE BALL
AAAH I CRIED I DON'T HAVE WORDS!The soundtrack. The voice acting. The animation. This sequence is a masterpiece from start to finish.I have watched this clip so many times at this point that I know the dialogue word by word. This scene is really up there for the best Haikyu!! scenes.There's so many great moments in this scene and the ones before and after it, the opposing team yelling hurry go back, Yamaguchi loosing his footing before running to Kageyama and Hinata, Tsukishima's trust and respect for Hinata and Kageyama, the coach frantically trying to get his team to calm down and my favorite part Hinata's smile and calm approach in the mist of chaos as he receives the ball allowing his team to reset, proving Hinata is the glue that holds this team together.I started Haikyu in December, finished it all within a week and half, I’m already rewatching this show, such a great show with some badass soundtracks!Just finished watching this episode had to come here this was so amazing!!I think that the focus on Tsuki and Daichi at 1:28 is to show that Karasuno's best defensive players are at the back from the previous play, so Karasuno is vulnerable...When the twins did the minus tempo back attack and the banner read:
“WE DON’T NEED THE MEMORIES”
That was the most pleasurable scene hands down. Production IG nailed the final rally of the match. So intense and phenomenal.This was kinda overshadowed by the block, but that last attack by the twins is probably the best quick in Haikyu, PERIOD.Karasuno called.
They want their Quick back, Inarizaki.It hurts me so much that kita said that they were going to win....when he saw that ball drop he was in complete shock. Not to mention that was his first and last game in all of high school."I'm sorry, Hinata. I will never use the word fluke in reference to you again"I like how they put EVERYTHING they had on that single scene of the ball falling reflected on kita's eyes. INSANEI always liked how Pete built Kevin back up after he made a mistake.“Actually that was the sound of me eating spaghetti, but imma let them think the other thing”
So good😂I can't believe they cut out the reason why XD

"Pam called to berate the client only days after the death of their mother... who struggled with obesity for her entire life."The actor who plays Kevin does a great job tapping into the psyche of a child.When Pete extends his hand for a fist bump Kevin looks like a child who just won a teddy at the carnivalErin: Ladies and gentlemen, we lost a client
Everyone: YESSSSSS!“You wouldn’t fart on a butterfly” literally never heard that input until I watched the office best show ever 😂😂😂😂"It's all about the mistakes"

A Great life lesson right there ladies and gentlemen.without Michael's leadership,  and without Andy singing in the office,  this is what happens.  Even Jimothy could have made differenceI dunno why people hated Pete so much. He was lowkey chill asfWhenever I see Kevin sad it makes me feel bad, he's not dumb but he just acts different, and when he fist bumped Pete and smiled my heart warmed."Remember you are a scum bag and you think scummy thoughts."
                 - CreedCreed is awesome, he just needs few words and takes away the whole scene.you can tell Pam is the sweetest character when she was rising her hand to say she’s never received a complaint 🥺🥺🥺❤️"we just lost a client!" 
(cheering)For me. It’s all about how Erin looks at Pete. It’s half “that’s how you bring a team together and encourage people and you said exactly the words that were yearning to escape from my soul” and half “I want you to be the father of my children”.I love how Pete was so calm and so quick to defend Kevin when everyone yelled at him.I felt bad for Kevin, he looks so sad and distressed that he ruined it for everyone."Come on you can fail. I see failure in you!" I don't know how to feel if someone encourage me to fail but this is hilarious 😂Pam raising her hand just a little bit is so adorableThe way Pam says “No I wouldn’t. I can’t even relate to that impulse.” 😂 how is she anything other than perfectI love at the end how they come to realization that they actually lost a client😂Once the office was authentic and very relatable, meanwhile so subtly funny; 
season 9 is just so forced and unbelievable, I really don’t believe Pam or any other employees will deliberately lose a client for a game😅A friendly reminder that Ryan started the fire and Kevin destroyed the tower😂3:05 I like how Kevin is the only one confused about how to feel about the company losing a client LOLEveryone needs a friend like Pete.1:51 her little dance is so cute ಥ‿ಥThis is such a good show it’s so relatable and funny like who wouldn’t imagined that a random paper company in Scranton would be so entertaining 😃This automatically shows that Pete is a better person than everyone in that roomThe look Creed makes while showing how to think scummy thoughts... Just pure gold <3 XDIt was weird seeing Pam do that to someone over the phoneThe best part is when they’re chanting Pam’s name and Kevin is pumping his arms in the air dangerously close to the tower 😂  Pete’s like woah woahThe expression of Pam seeing Creed's face in minute 2:12 is priceless.Michael was there to hold stupidity in himself and let their employees shine.
Without Michael all they become stupids.Fun fact : Creed Bratton doesn't stick to the script but he's improvisingThe moment they realized they lost a client😂1:50 is amazing 😂 The way Pete is so worried hahahaYeah , let's make Pete magically sound great and kinda like Jim so nobody can complain about him hooking up with the receptionist , peak story tellingPete is mad cool.  He seems like such a chill guy.Pam just wanted a complain and it turned out so bad but funny😭Pam is an absolute queen - also Kevin is devastatedWithout watching this show I thought Pete was a clueless character but after watching the show I realise he’s one of the only normal ones thereThe ending when they all finally realize its a bad thing 😂😂😂😂Their looks when they realize they lost their biggest client. Priceless!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I love how they try to get someone to hate their company so they can get a slip of a paperEvery time I see this, I'm like why would you deliberately insult a client? They'll either want the person fired or they'll just stop doing business with you. You want to do something less big and direct to get a complaint. I get it's all for the gag, but I feel like at least Pam should've realized it was a poor idea.as someone who worked at a trucking company in HR. these dialogues are 100 accurate. plus the parties. there was at least a party every two weeks.2:54 proof that Dwight's doomsday device was justifiedI can't believe they've wasted all of their time building a tower and lost a client on the same day! So good!Pam is so cute i cant anymore she could totally start streaming 🤣😂so cute how pam dances 1:52People always said Pete was lame or boring, but I honestly always really liked him. He always made Erin smile so much, was a super nice guy, and he was so much better for Erin than Andy or Gabe. Pete is underratedThat realization of what they had done at the end 😂😂it cute how supportive everyone in the cast of the office is to each other 
well, michael and toby being an exception obviouslyCreed always steals the show in less than 5 seconds !We need a compilation of Dwight annoying Meredith.pam dancing when they clapped for her is so cuteIT NEVER GETS OLD"Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client" 
*pam who is now included* "A small price to pay"Pete is like the non-sociopath version of JimFind someone who looks at you the way Erin looks at PeteI have way more respect for Pete now after he gave his ted talk and cheered up Kevin" C'mon you can fail , I can see failure in YOU " 😂😂😂Kevin's sad face makes me feel really sypatheticThis office is paradise. If it was a real office, Pam and Jim would have been fired first episodeI want someone to look at me the way Erin looked at PeteKevin is like the dorky younger brother of your best friend.I never really watched much of the US version of The Office, or the British version either, didn't realize Catherine Tate was part of the US cast. I've always liked her comedy.I like how Pam is wearing a sweater of "Pratt Institute" Art College. 🎓kevin cheering on the background is just everythingThey didn’t even show her getting the actual complaint just her losing the customer😂Everyone realizing what they've just done is the best partWe will never know what Creed's scummy thought was💀😭✌🏻I love the fact that Creed is wearing sweatpants, green crocs and zones in and out of his acting. see 1:49This scene just ensure Pete being like JimPete and Erin here felt like Jim and Pam especially when he gave that speech to not be mad at KevinUnpopular opinion:
Nellie is actually really funny“We just lost a client yeah”

Don’t they live on commission? LMAOI love creed's shoes and pants in this 😂The realization after the celebration is goldWatching this just reminds me of how much of a letdown season nine was.Dunno why I didn't like Pete first time I watched this, he's a cool guythose who don't cry at his sad face cannot physically cry of have no EMOTIONAL CAPABILITIESWhy is Creed wearing sweatpants...
Also love how Pete is trying to hold Kevin’s arms backGotta love the officethe first scene just shows kevins capability of doing anythingIt was a mistake to not end the show after Michael Scott left."Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!"
*thunderous applause*Oh that Pete guy was actually pretty wholesome here. And Erin notices it too 😉"no i wouldn't, i can't even relate to that impulse" i'm dead lmao"I can't even relate to that impulse" :'D legendary polite burnPete acts like a young Jim. awesomeThis almost gave me a heart attack, the first time I saw thisIf only Kevin had a hype man when he spilled his pot of gold all over the floor.“You wouldn’t even fart on a butterfly” wtf Meredith lmaoI get real sad when people lump Pete in with that other guy. This scene alone makes Pete at least a decent person in an office where there aren’t thaaat many. That should make him at least a little enjoyable, right?Has anyone ever noticed how much Pete resembles Peter Weller, the actor of the original Robocop?
Every time I wonder if they are related in some ways.It was Pam's first complaint because it was the only time she did any sales work.1:46 just realised Creed was wearing sweatpants and green crocs🤣🤣You know, I was never happy they ruined Andy and Erin's relationship but I do like the guy she ended up with.The fact that they were so happy losing a small account client (i hope)means the sales team is rocking with new clients everyday."Ladies and Gentlemen, we just lost a client! **loud cheering**" I just can' t :DCreed is the ultimate motivator.Creed needed more lines🤣Imagin, Andy gave the intern the nickname Plop and he still stole Erin from him.Creed’s advice to Pam helped a little too muchWhen you’re so early that Ryan isn’t the fire guy yetPete is best guy I’ve ever knowA lot of people say that they don’t like Pete but this scene right here 0:41 is what made him likeable for meIsn't Pam's first complaint when Jim put one in the suggestion jar that Pam should not plan her wedding at the office?Not everybody calling Pam a failure😂😂plop is the chillest dude ever"I can't even relate to that impulse"🤣I need to know what Creed was thinking there! 😂😂😂1:50 why does creed look so annoyed 😂Exactly why Pam is the most hated character. She definitely has had complaints, just not in card form.How does losing clients be this happy😂Just goes to show that Pam is the worst at everything."If you're afraid of screwing up, the tower's not for you" Roland Deschain“You wouldn’t fart on a butterfly” is something I now say.I can totally picture Meredith farting on a butterfly and now i cant stop laughing.I LOVE PETE SO MUCHPete trying to act like Jim was cringy af to watch, also I'm pretty sure he'd never joke around and purposely lose a client.Man it seems like a different show to me in these later seasons.That moment Pam has never had any complaints because she's one of the worst salesmen in the Branch.I'm still in love with Pam.The redheads hyping her up😂😂These 2 last seasons are agony incarnateAnd Scranton was the best branch at Dunder Mifflin, imagine the others 😂Creed's "encouragement" 😂😂The epitome of "I've won, but at what cost.."Erin: “We just lost a client”
Everyone: “LET’S FUCKING GOOOOO”when you hate your life, dont just assume that everyone hates life too0:43 who else saw tom cruise like acting here? great stuff"Actually that was the sound of me eating spaghetti" MoodI love PeteThe office dropped off bad in season 8 and 9. Classic tale of us sitcoms that go on way longer than they should.“ladies and gentlemen… we just lost a client”
*everybody cheers*F in the chat for my boi Kevin, he was just trying to help.I miss this show 😞Darrell was fuckin that spaghetti up 😂"I can't even relate to that impulse" hahahaNever saw a girl be so happy when getting a complainthaahhahahahahahahaha look 1:46 creed is wearing crocs 😂1:46 Creed with his green crocks gray sweats matched with his shirt suit and tie 😜Awe Pam wouldn't fart on a butterfly 😌"I know you can fail, i see failure in you"Ladies and gentlemen....*WE JUST LOST A CLIENT!*Kevin's sad face can make Thanos and voldemort cry in one secErin looks so cute in this episodepete is like the bestCreed's neon- green crocs were the highlight of the office.When I think of basic girl I think of PamPete was the second jim
He even dated the reciptionist“You wouldn’t fart on a butterfly” 
😂
Meredith you crack me upIt is kind of fun to criticize people in groups when they do a mistake like that... hate the people who stop it like this ...Spaghetti: exists
Dogs: *OUR* spaghetti
I love spaghetti, goes great with Kevin's world famous chiliIf ur girl look at you like Erin , take her never let goIs Pete is the ONLY normal one which makes the show even MORE weird?There was a way to get a complaint and keep the client"Like a phoenix from the ashes" 
Ozai: *wants to know your location*I did not notice that creed was wearing sweatpants with a suit. Creed is a different breedI'm sorry I can't watch this show without Micheal ScottNo Dwight. No Michael. No Jim. This is what happens.when you hate your life, dont just assume that everyone hates life tooNicole was born to be a mom, the emotions she shows while talking about her baby boy is so overwhelming and Brie is already an amazing mom to Birdie and now BuddyThis makes me so happy.

The love for their babies, the love Birdie has for the boys, the love between the partners, the love between the sisters.This story is so incredibly amazing ,,, Brie hit the nail on the head when she said that those little boys had to come to this life together... such a testament to the spiritual beliefs had by many that we plan our lives before we are born. Those little boys are on a mission! And what is so cool is that they are genetically closer than most cousins. They are technically like half siblings genetically speaking. Congrats to all of you! Your lives have been so blessed!I’m so proud and happy for Nicole that she finally gets to live her dream of become a mom I’m so happy for Nicole and artemMy daughter was y'all biggest fan. She was 13yrs old when she passed away from leukemia 😰😰 She legit would've been ecstatic about you ladies giving birth, especially for you Nikki. Congrats, momma's❣️❣️It is really taking everything out of me not to burst into tears to see nikki's dreams finally come true and not letting the opportunity to be a mother pass her by. Its the most incredible feeling in the world. Noone and I mean NOONE will ever truly know how pure love is until you become a parent! 💙After seeing the pain Nikki went through with John, I'm so glad she chose her own dreams & now has her baby 😍💓Artem and Bryan seem like such nice guys from watching the show they always treat the girls with such respect nice to see they’ve found great guys and congratulations to them all for becoming parents well the congrats to Brie and Bryan for the second time 🎉Congratulations to both families! What a heartwarming and special story about how your sons began their lives. Looking forward to watch your love and blessings continue to flourish. 💕Am I the only one who is bawling listening to Nikki talk about the love she has for her son! 😭😭❤️ so precious and beautiful!So happy 4 both but I’m thrilled that Nikki got to be the mom she always wanted to be.Just when you think your losing , something greater comes in! This was meant for Nikki and Bre. I love it, the joy and love that flows over them! Such a blessing 💘I can't stop smiling watching this I'm so happy for both of them especially Nikki she always wanted this she deserved it she got her self a good man and got her a beautiful baby boyI just love seeing how happy they both are! Brie was only nervous cause their was alot going on with her relationship! But Nikki was terrified and just did not know what why or how (how I was with my 2nd). So to see them both so happy is amazing!Ahhh, watching this made me so emotional.  Im so happy for both of them being able to experience this together and seeing Nikki express her love for her baby...she finally became what she wanted to be , a mom. Im so happy she has a nurturing a supportive man by her side also. So good.❤✨I never really liked them in wrestling but I want to cry watching this, especially for Nikki, she deserves this, she’s wanted this even more than the divas title, i’m so happy for them. they’re gonna be amazing 💘Congratulations to both of them happy for you both.  Both babies are beautiful.  It's so nice to see nikki happy and finally being a mom she deserves it.How can you not adore these 2. Following Nicole's story from the day she told JC what she always wanted to seeing where everything in her life led her to this moment. So happy for her! And exactly this was fate. This is why Brie didn't get pregnant when they wanted. It doesn't happen in our time all good things happen in God's timing. Bless these 2 beautiful families. I knew Brie would have a 2nd and it be a boy. I think she just freaked out cuz she wasn't getting pregnant, so it's easier to convince yourself you don't want a 2nd. So happy for the 2 of you getting this experience together and God Bless you both on your beautiful baby boys! Congrats!So happy for them both and their husbands and big sister bird. God bless their babies 👶❤️❤️🎈🎈👶I am so happy for Nikki and Brie!  The boys are very blessed to have beautiful, talented, mama’s!

I’m soooo happy for you guys..and your health beautiful, adorable ,precious babies!!!👶🏻👶🏻🍼🍼😘😘I’m so happy for you Nikki you deserve it hunYou never understand until and unless your a mother. And i can tell you; Birdy being nurturing comes from what she sees. You don't see it until you see how other kids are and where their personality comes from. You would think it comes with being a mother, but not all mothers are good mothers. Its okay to be proud of the job we do to be patient, loving, compassionate and much more. Our little people, learn from their foundation. And with that foundation paves the road to be who they become. Congratulations!Nikki is so funny and real, I don't  think she realised they had to blip her.  Lolomg thats twinning right there, both had boys, 22 hours apart???? you couldnt make that up.i’m so happy for both of themI know as a sister even though you fight and fuss you wanna see your sister happily married and get everything she ever wanted glad that both twins can win💜I am having goosebumps listening to their story 😍😊Nikki,  I am so happy for you! Being a mom is the most amazing gift that anyone could ever ask for! I am also a first time mom and I love my baby so much! I woke up every hour to make sure she was breathing... such a new mom thing lol. Artem is a prince! Plz marry him!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰Love this video, so happy for you guys. I laughed when Brie  told the story about Birdie asking if she can breastfeed the baby. 💙Nikki is the oldest and her baby boy is the oldest this is so amazing I’m so proud of her and brie 🥰I am so happy for both of them!I’m so happy for them❤️❤️Nikki is living her best life with a good man and a sweet baby, and her haters can't stand it!

And with Brie she was trying for so long and when they gave up baby came.
What this have thought me is two different things: From Brie side things happen on its own and Nikki stop fighting to be with someone who's not willing to sacrifice things for you......

Edit : omg 1.1K in 5 minBTS is like a book, we all are readers,the reason why HATERS hate them is because they skipped the important pages in the book, while ARMYS read the whole book from beginning to this moment when they are successful artist..........Hicimos un gran trabajo army!! no se preocupen y sigamos!!BTS vino de una pequeña empresa, empezaron sin nada.
Jin, quien fue expulsado solo por su apariencia, Suga, quien dejó a su familia y apostó su educación solo para hacer lo que realmente quería ser,
Namjoon que nunca fue apoyado por sus padres,
Jimin que se creía feo y gordo,
Taehyung que siempre formó parte de BTS pero nunca se mostró en ninguna promoción, no hasta el debut,
Hoseok, que siempre parecía reír, pero nunca se sintió como un logro para su padre y Jungkook, quien era muy tímido y había salvado a sus padres a temprana edad mediante una audición a empresas.
¿Recuerdas los días en que estaban luchando?
¿Incluso tuvieron que sacrificarse y trabajar duro para poder comer?
Se estaban apretando en un pequeño apartamento y tuvieron que asumir responsabilidades, la razón por la que escribieron la canción "move"

Esos momentos en que Jimin tiene que morirse de hambre solo porque la gente lo llama gordo y feo.
Esa entrevista donde Yoongi dijo eso; fue agradable que la gente escuchara su música porque Taehyung y Jungkook son guapos.
Y pensó que al menos era suficiente. ¿Te acuerdas de cuando se suponía que Hoseok era el vocalista y Taehyung el rapero, pero en su lugar eligió el rap y aprenderlo porque Taehyung quería ser el vocalista?
Era el sueño de Taehyungs y Hoseok ama su dongsaeng que tanto sacrificaría.

Otros fanáticos los acusaban de plagio solo porque tenían el más mínimo detalle, lo mismo con otros grandes grupos de Kpop, que en realidad era solo una coincidencia.
Hubo un momento en que Yoongi empacó 300 regalos y cartas solo para darles a sus 300 fanáticos que asistirán a sus mini reuniones de fanáticos.
Entonces, ¿por qué las personas los juzgan tan rápido?
¿Sabías que Jimin llegó hasta Seúl desde Busan solo para perseguir sus sueños?
¿Sabías que Taehyung vivió con su abuela durante casi la mitad de su vida haciéndolo inocente de todo lo que hay en nuestro mundo?
¿Sabías que Jungkook dejó de lado su vergüenza solo para satisfacer las expectativas del otro?
Sí, él es el maknae Dorado, pero también sufre cuando ve que sus hyungs están teniendo dificultades, llora.
Y hubo un momento en que Jimin lo atrapó llorando y la razón fue porque extrañaba a su familia.
Jungkook a menudo llora en secreto para que sus hyungs no se preocupen.
¿Sabías que Jin hizo una audición para hacer que su madre se enorgulleciera de él y para que su madre tuviera algo de qué presumir ante esos vecinos críticos que tenían?
Trabajó duro en su voz, pero la gente lo llamó sin talento.
¿Sabías que Namjoon trabajó duro solo para producir canciones pero hubo un momento en que su madre arruinó su computadora y rompió su micrófono para que pudiera concentrarse en estudiar?
¿Sabías que Hoseok audicionó porque quería que su padre estuviera orgulloso de él?
¿Porque sintió que era una decepción?

Esos días de novatos en los que solo escucharon los premios y se sorprendieron de sus mayores.
No pudieron hacer nada más que observar a los ídolos que recibieron los premios.
Estaban contentos.
Y ahora llegaron a la cima y se volvieron más exitosos. De 150 aficionados a 6mil y contando,
De una pequeña sala de práctica a una más grande.
Desde un dormitorio estrecho con compañeros de cuarto a un dormitorio grande, cada uno de ellos era un cuarto,
Desde un premio Daesang hasta más premios e incluso han ganado en BBMA.
BTS nunca esperó esto antes de su cuarto año de aniversario, han llegado tan lejos, hasta el momento que la única posibilidad que tenemos de verlos es ir a su concierto (NUNCA)
Encuéntralos en la calle con un 0.01% de probabilidad.
Pero realmente ARMYs !! ¡Hemos llegado hasta aquí, queridos, amémoslos y brindémosles nuestro apoyo hasta el final!
Quería agradecerles a todos. Te amo BTS! Permanezcamos juntos hasta el final. Si crees en lo que he dicho. Si crees en 1! 2! 3! 💜🥰Army aún que no lleguemos a la meta en las 24 horas hay que seguir haciendo stream hasta llegar aún que el tiempo pase, sabemos que ellos merecen lo mejor:'3 
 FIGHTING!

Army, even though we don't reach the goal in 24 hours, we have to keep streaming until time passes, we know that they deserve the best  FIGHTING!

군대는 우리가 24 시간 안에 목표에 도달하지 못하더라도 시간이 지날 때까지 스트리밍을 계속해야합니다. 우리는 그들이 최고를받을 자격이 있다는 것을 압니다.

الجيش ، على الرغم من أننا لم نصل إلى الهدف
 خلال 24 ساعة ، يتعين علينا مواصلة البث حتى يمر الوقت ، ونحن نعلم أنهم يستحقون الأفضل 

Army, même si nous n'atteignons pas l'objectif en 24 heures, nous devons continuer à diffuser jusqu'à ce que le temps passe, nous savons qu'ils méritent le meilleur FIGHTING!Just three words  ㅠㅠ ... I cry now ... and cry a cry I have never cried like him in my life because of the amount of feelings in this album..Bangtan always makes us cry out of joy, from happiness and sometimes from sadness ... But now..Now..i  I cry because the warmth and tenderness of the album and the song made me feel very strange..no..I cannot know what this feeling is..It makes me in a state of sadness, happiness, panic, the desire to laugh and the desire to cry ... It always gives us very beautiful feelings ..  And what you felt about this album specifically is completely different from any album and any song previously..It really ... really makes you feel a warmth and a very beautiful feeling like the feeling of your mother’s embrace of you or the warmth of your family..woooo .... This year a lot of things have happened and most of them  Sadness and events at all that we did not expect in 2020 ... it was a really crazy year! ... But this album, the songs in it, its lyrics, its melody, the beauty of its meanings and its feeling ... made me feel that this year was more than exhausting, sad and very strange..but we had Bangtan  As medicine for all of these things ... When they encourage us when they make us happy, make us laugh, or make us laugh, or make us laugh, and tell us everything will be fine and fine .. and b  Stay with us all this year in order not to be sad or exhausted in it too much ... Bangtan I don’t know how to do that..how to make us cry and laugh and grieve at the same time .. Oh, you really ... you really make me believe that we are all here to love and  We are happy, cry, mourn and happy together, not just by ourselves!  .... .. I cannot write because I am crying now and my eyes are shedding tears strongly..that is why I will say that we love you so much, we love what you make for us, we love that you care about what we love and what we want .... and you care about our grief and relieve our pain ... and you care about words and how you want them  To reach us..we love you and we will love you forever .... you are life and happiness for us..we love you very, very much..and as you please us, we will return the favor to you too..so wait ... we love you so much ... I throw anything away from you.  About our goals that we have been planning for for months ... Leave everything and focus on the album and broaden Bangtan ... Team work makes the dream come true! .. Fighting.I would die for these 7 angels, that don’t even know I exist...Everyone: This year has been terrible
Army: Not for us!
BTS: Yeah, life goes on...Stop saying “like if your bias is...” because no matter who your bias is, you’ll always appreciate and support them all equally if you’re a true ARMY!Yoongi: “People feel despair because they cannot see the future, they will be able to move forward if they see any light. I want my music to become that light for those in the dark. I want them to heal from it and find the courage to move forward again.  Sometimes I hate it and sometimes I love it, but I don't think I can live without it, but in a way it is a relationship of love and hate, sometimes I don't think I can live without it, if I imagine myself not performing or making music, then my life will be meaningless

 - 8 years of creativity, thank Yoongi for being part of BTS and part of our beautiful family ... We miss you, we love you🤍

        Editorial:            Probably the most thought-provoking 
one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no 
matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned 
against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? 
Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust 
after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever 
looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by 
your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and 
we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on 
Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be 
guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for
 you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God 
commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ
 died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God 
promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their 
sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not 
have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the 
Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Umm actually light block was in the game and you can get it by /give @s light_block 1 1 the last number is the light radius and brightnessCan everyone on bedrock shut up? We know you have light blocks. We don’t go around bragging about the debug stick.Why did I think you were quackityLook up Minecraft: rule 34Wait a sec is 1.17 out for bedrock and the other oneDid Xbox insider get this before pc coz we’ve had this for a while now?One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈Is it on switch wet?I’ve used light blocks beforeExcuse you sir I do a lot of stuff.Se parece al de rap de minecraft XDDDDDI'm on xbox so I cna that eto update 😭😭lol this is trending

7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

RESPECT!!!!Just got into this dudes music recently, quickly realizing he's got the potential to be one of the most important artists of this generation. Music is so influential hes really got a chance at changing the world for the better.I love this guy!  As a woman in my early 50's, I've never been into rap at all.  But, his message is so spot on.  Great lyrics.  Great melodies.  Very unique.  He's doing to me what GnR did to get me into Rock in the 90s.  Thanks for being you, being true, and keeping it real.when he admits his jewelry is fake, thats when you know he is realYou deserve everything you worked hard. True heroes in my eyes. You and Nova rock. Peace peeps ❤❤This song is the core at why i respect Tom 100% he is genuine and real. You cant find that in todays society let alone with anyone that gets some fame. You can tell hes everything he speaks 👊✊Real People LOVE this kind of music!
Beautifull deep lyrics and great beats!
Never stop with your good work!Hey Tom,
Keep doing what what you are doing, because your songs resonate in the minds and hearts of listeners who feel the same way as your lyrics..God bless and keep dropping the tunes.The best thing about your music other than the immense truth you speak is how the lyrics are composed to be perfectly child friendly if anything they tell truths that the next generations needs to hereTom gets so much unnecessary hate for literally saying the truth.This guy is getting all generations liking his musicHow would someone dislike a song like this, the only rapper i know with the potential to change the world, @Tom Macdonald to the world❤I feel blessed to have found TOM and the hangover family, in the middle of Idaho, at 71, with my wild turkeys and town deers, and now, TOM music to smooth my Soulyou are a serious talent bro, don't apologise for finding comfort with ya girl , good on ya man, its made my year finding your music , never stopThis guy has evey generations attention.

You earned everything you got and then some. Thank you for being real. 🙏🙏I was done with most music rap for damn sure till I heard this man and now I'm like a teen again dusted off the subs turn it up and feel the music like I never been able to ever THANK YOU so much TomEvery song is amazing its own way.  Never seen anything like itThank you so much for this impeccable content. I can get use to a critically thinking artist who incorporates valuable messages in the lyrics. I've listened to every song and have been enriched, amazed, and experienced an array of different emotions.Tom, I only recently discovered you on Amazon Music as I was playing songs that were like NF. Then "People So Stupid" rolled into my ears. I literally stopped working on the machine that I was repairing and had to listen to your song multiple times. From there I was like WHO IS THIS!? The more I have learned and listened to regarding your music is inspiring. In all areas it bring hope in these times that are uncertain. My kids now listen to you and they, all 5 of them, are all so different from their siblings. What I am saying is, you music and message reaches and impacts anyone who listens. Even if they don't agree with each line, you are "spitting truths" as my LGBTQ Daughter says. Much respect for not letting this fame and attention change your soul. It shows great character in you and I look forward to watching your career continue to inspire and change people. You just dropped "Snow Flake" and again you are on point and thank you for standing and being you.He knows at this point he deserves everything he's worked for. 

As he fuckin' should.You tell em Tom, if they can't love you through everything and know who you are no matter what, then they aren't worthy of youIt seems like real is making a comeback!!!  Blessings all the way from Jamaica,  Tom🙏 your music makes days easierIve never heard this one but I love it more then the others. I love how original and real you are. Keep going big and speaking the truth.. you and ur girl are killing it!!This dudes got a good fucking heart I pray he keeps prospering and everybody who reads this I pray you truly get what your heart truly desires and needs. We need ppl like Thomas he really is a special person in this chaotic world.You didn't sell out bro, upgrading your life , you both DESERVE that.Gotta love this brother! Touches the heart & soul deeply 🤍 Nothing but love & respect!!!Aint no selling out here! It's called coming up and being RECOGNIZED for being the absolute BADA$S that you are! 
You are the voice this world so desperately needs to hear and I pray you continue to prosper in GIANT WAYS for bucking the system and proving that you CAN make it big WITHOUT selling your soul!! 🙌
THANKS FOR ALL YOU DO &...
LET'S GOOOOOO!!! 👊❤🤘I’ll never understand why people wouldn’t want their favorite artist to be successful 🤷‍♀️I thank you Tom for being real and put words to everything I feel and went through!!I love watching his life story 🤩🤩 everything he's been thru and everything hes doing now.

So exciting to see you and Nova made it through the rough times and came out on top!  Stay true to you and you'll never fail.  ❤️You deserve the best in life. You and Nova have shown the world what it's really Ike to be the one everyone wants to cancel in the music industry. Your both incredibly talented and I hope all your dreams are coming true.This is one of my most favorite songs from Tom. I don't understand how this doesn't have 10million+ views already.I voted for a president who gave up his riches to save America not for a president who sold out America to attain riches !! #WakeUp #AmericaFirstYou are a lyrical genius spitting the truth and staying real! At 42, I thought I was done listening to rap then I found you and I'm hooked! Your message is everything I believe and stand for so I can actually look up to you fully. And I hope the rest of the world follows. @TomMacDonald❤ your voice.  I could listen to Tom all day!This is one of my absolute favorite songs I love all of your music. The people love you, Tom. Keep being you. And seeing you and Nova make it like everyone else is trying to. Yall worked hard and deserve the fruits from yalls labor. Fuck the haters yall are awesome and a great role model for anyone to look up to. Love yall bunches! Thomas and Nova, yall r the best!This guy seems so genuine. I'm in my fifties, never listened to rap in my entire life because I couldn't understand it.  This young man is amazing and should be completely respected for his talent because no one in the entire music industry can come close to him.  One of the greatest things is that he remains humble and true to himself.  May God continue to bless him.I love the messaging your talent brings, continued good success to you and your family Tom!!!Oh Tom, you did it again! This song re-sparks my love for the simple fact that you may have loads of money but you're a simple and honest guy; someone who deserves to have financial freedom and things you finally want.I'm a 57 year old white woman. I listen to your words and cry with joy. You are a brave man speaking your heart. Your journey is inspiring.  Please know you are touching lives you would never expect.   Thank you for sharing your music and passion, it is appreciated.You are the face AND voice of what we all feel inside on a daily basis,so keep that  head up and continue with your awesome messages that give us fans hope.This song makes me feel sad. Anyone who has followed your journey from the beginning knows that you never sold out. If they fucked with you in the beginning, they should understand that you are a work in progress. We all are.

Hating because you gained success is not being a real fan. You still speak nothing but truth. Not wanting you to come up is being hateful. I do think a lot of us hope you stay independent so that you can stay true to yourself, but being able to support your family and take care of yourself is not selling out. That's just fake fans and jealous people. If they really cared, they'd be thrilled to see you doing well.

Hoping someone stays in their struggles is a shitty way to be. Keep up the grind and I hope you are happier now than you were when things were at their lowest. You have helped so many of us. I believe you rose and took a lot of us with you. Thank you. 💙Another excellent song and video Tom. You and Nova are a terrific team. I’ve never been to a rap concert before but if you ever do one in my neck of states (El Paso, TX for now) I’d absolutely be there.You can tell a lot about someone by how dogs act around them.

You, sir, are a gem. Never change.All I got to say is there is a massive difference between selling out and enjoying success. Telling kids that it's cool to drink lean and snort xanax for a pay out is selling out. Making large stacks of cash telling kids they don't need that shit is legit success and there is absolutely zero shame in that. From a fellow Canadian, I'm glad you're doing so well without the record labels' help and I wish you and Nova nothing but great fortune and happiness.This song touches the soul.  Amazing work.Tom, love your music.
Only thing I wanna say is don't feel discouraged to change, we all must evolve, most of us just wanna be a better version of ourselves.  I think you have reached that point, you inspire me to wanna be better!My fave. And I’m in my mid 40s!!! Authenticity wins. Being comfortable where you are at is the triumph over trauma. You and your crew address this. ♥️i appreciate you bro. each song is different, but they all hit the mark. keep being real and giving indie artists hopePeople always ask me why I dont listen to much hip hop. I cant relate to it. But this is different. There is raw emotion. Tom you have a way of verbalizing many of the thoughts ive had for years. Thank you for sharing your truth. It shines like a beacon in the darkness that hangs over our land. I wish I could help you build your sets. I would do it for free.One of my favorite songs of yours! Love the way you can sing in different ways, even sounding “country”! Keep it real!If toms a sell out then every artist ever doesn’t matter what genre is a sell out. He got himself out the hood and into a better life, all I see is a man evolving and providing as much as he can for his family.I love his message he puts out in the broke world. Dig his style. It was cute too see that Nova was standing below him trying to catch him if he fell ❤️ I seen how they support each other just by that scene! #goalsI’m a 47 year old mom of a 6 and 11 year old. Never could stand rap with the hos and f bombs drugs and consumerism. Once my boys get a bit older I’m going to have them listen to you. Life is not about money, or fame. It’s about love family and friends. And to hear that in music today is a rarity. Thanks Tom.You’re the only rapper that’s worth a damn out there in the industry right nowBought all the albums last month, he has loads of killer songs that are not on YouTube. By far one of the best artists active today all genres. HOG keep it goingTaking care of your family, making you better, and giving your girl a better life is not being a sellout. Keep doing you. You're inspirational.Damn. You’re gifted my friend. Haven’t heard a track I don’t like.
You have a great message and an incredible gift.
Bless youI really love the way he responds to fan criticisms. just sits down an explains himself when by no metric does he need toNo idea how I missed this video!! Been a fan since helluvit! Love that we get to witness your growth as an artist and anyone saying you sold out can eat a bag of.... Well you know... Lol keep being awesome !!This man is far from a sell-out. He grinds and flies in the face of "conventional wisdom" in the industry. Love you, Tom!One of the best rapper present. But its sad that the industry won't appreciate him for his honesty and opinions.God bless you Tom!!
Coming from a non religious guy, that's heart felt
Love your work 
Greetings from the UK 
Take care
GrahamAll you do is speak the truth i got mad respect for you you music is helping get thru alot and I couldnt thank you enough honestly.. You have my full supportTom speaks to me with his music like no other can these days. This is why I started listening to rap. He doesn't even know how important this is for my mental health alone. So basically I just want to say thanks. And much love to anyone who can relate to what I'm trying to say <3Still be the voice of every single lonely person with a story
They can't tell because they never had nobody
Thank you tomThe only person you ever sold out to is you. Keeping selling out to yourself, and being true and real to yourself. You are an inspiration to millions.I can’t thank my ex enough for showing me your music I love your music it is inspiring and it really speaks to me and I’ve listened to every song."Still be the voice of every single lonely person with a story they can't tell because they have never had no body" People need to listen to this  because this is real. I appreciate that you can be so real and raw with your lyric, you don't sugar coat you jst say what is real and we need more people who can express these things and expose it to the people so they can understand.❤ thank you for being a voice for those of us who need your wordsThe only person who has been able to get me into rap & actually share rap videos! And I’m no spring chicken either. Keep up the good work dude - love your stuff, love your independence too. You and Nova - what a team.THIS MAN IS A BEAST!! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT!!My guy shouldn’t be punished for changing for the better 💪🔥🙏I’m not the biggest fan of the music, as in the beat… but every so g I’ve heard, the lyrics are amazing… he definitely has talent, and it’s so refreshing hearing a rapper talk about what’s really going on in our country today. I definitely respect the hell out of this guy, and will absolutely support him.Needed to find this right now 👊🌻❤️ thanks guys you always make the best music and videos to match!  You have no idea what you do for some people!your not a sellout. fuk i love your music. really gives me a different perspective of life. we battle so many demons in our life but we can rise up and overcome big ups tom.I am in my 50's and you are literally the only person who does rap I would listen to. Let the haters hate, they have nothing else to do. They hate because they don't have the balls to get up and make their own changes. Never apologize for wanting better for yourself and family. Thank you for always saying it how it is, much respect for that. Stay happy, do you and be blessed!I love this song.  It was truly touching to hear actual promises from Tom to never glorify drugs etc. to our youth. Tom is a badass role model for our kids bc he has the depth of character and a big heart, yet he’s all man.   Definitely no soy.  Lucky Nova.  
But this song….I haven’t had a song feel so genuine to me in the longest time.  So much respect for not selling out and promising to stay independent.Hey Tom, I just became a fan about 2 weeks ago. Love your bars, they hit deep. Keep it up!I love this music video, it really shows Tom MacDonald how real of a person he is. Like a day in a life of Tom MacDDonald. Its so wholesome. He is not actually a sell out. He does not deserve any dislikes.You’re a humble guy, that’s patently obvious, many prayers for you and your family.Realist song ever!!! I love your music 🥰thank you TomI’ve been listening to all of your stuff and I’m super amazed by the gift you have.

Fuck those losers,  you have worked your ass off,  and deserve a nice house and nice things.  You’re an inspiration.   I can’t stop listening to your music.  All the love to you and yours.Just because you go and do better for yourself doesn't mean you sold out. People who want to stay stuck where they are get mad because you got out. I love your music from before and still nowHell brother.. I wish I had discovered you years ago. Best "New" artist in my book. Well done on illiciting some emotions that had been latent. Just send it Tom.Don't let the negativity drag you down. Do what makes you happy, because the ones you reach were always worth it in the end.I bet tom is one of the nicest guys in real life. Seems like such a self aware, intelligent dude.Dude 
You are awesome !!
I absolutely love your spirit bro
I’m happy for you 
Enjoy, you earned it🤙🏻✌🏻Love this song!! Thanks Tom, you be you!❤️I remember hearing this on the cd.  Admittedly I'm a new fan as I hadn't heard of Tom MacDonald prior to Covid.  Now I'm subscribed with notifications for every video.  Follow his ig and Facebook.  Own all his cds and bought some as Christmas gifts because I'm sharing the music with family who also enjoy him.  Respect for a man who made his own path when people said no.One of my favorite videos Keep being you Tom we need more like you. Truth is the greatest power given to us ., and you keep it real love it.Never heard of Tom MacDonald an hour ago & now I can’t stop listening. Good stuff.You did not sell out!

But you really are the GOAT.The rap is great but your actual singing voice is stunningly great!This is literally the most honest acknowledgement of being called a "sellout" I've ever heard. You're going to change, man, and so is your audience. We don't always agree on some of the political shit but I'll rock with you forever as long as you're honest about your feelings.

We got your back, Tom and NovaThis is beautiful. More power to the guy.Every song this guy has is incredible!! Not one trash song yetDAMN, I haven't listened go rap in so many years. It was all BS and sounded monotone, yet here is relative/relatable messages. Instantly subscribed. AND I didnt say anything until I saw this song because he is letting everyone know that he is legit and just a normal guy...but successful. BEST rapper I know. I hope Tom keeps releasing these AWESOME relatable songs that are against the establishment!!! Thank you Tom MacD!!!I've been at a VERY low point the past year, I've buried 2 sons in a year, no job, fiancee and i fighting, covid dividing us and our family.... your music inspired me and got me off my ass, now i got a good job, just got hired today... plz don't stop making music, actual music.... Tom, you've saved me and my family, i owe you more than you know... love yah Tom
#HOG4LIFE #SAVETOMMACDONALDTom be true to yourself bro. I just found out about you and your music a few days ago. I feel your lyrics and I agree with your  truth. Thank you  I know it is a lot of work but you are bringing truth and facts. Hit em with the truth.  Shake'm up Tom. You have mine and many people who support you.  Thank you  to your lady who helps you as well.   We need more good men like you in the world.  . God bless you brother.

Thank you .I love what you stand for…truth…honesty and self made… your amazing!Every song is just as good as the last with this man who agrees"Everything I was made me everything I am" one of the realest lines everTom you and Nova are amazing dude, don't bother with them fake fans cuz us real fans are never disappointed 💯💯
Keep on keeping on!! 💕Congrats on being a great musician screw haters and keep doing you.Honestly Tom keep doing you. Most people wouldn’t do what you’re doing rnMy new favorite artist. Thank you for what you're doing. Good luck broImagine battling the 3-1 Nuggets, the Clippers curse, & the Barkley guarantee at the same time 💀😂I like Kawhi. He seems like a good guy. I like how he said “ there’s no excuses” yet PG had all excuses 🤦🏻‍♂️I hear this man talk and he’s a good man. It’s the media that hyped him up that makes me get angry when he doesn’t get criticised like the greats they compare him tokawhi is a class act, no excuses like pandemic paul and docGreat shots in this game Leonard. Don't let it get you down. Next season will be the one.I should have stayed with a Nurse rather than a Doc this pandemic.

- Kawhi LeonardImagine having to give an interview after blowing a 3-1 lead on a global stage, would be so difficultKawhi is just gonna show up to Raptors practice and start shooting around like this season didn’t happenedI love Kawhi.  One of my favorite ballers along with Harden.  They're so talented, but yet so humble and calm.  I love their demeanor.  Keep on ballin Kawhi.  You'll get another one soon.He said “you know” more times than he made shots tonightI heard that some of the clippers didn't really want to practice and it's probably showed in their game some of these Superstars feel they don't need to practice because they're so good already but up and comers  like Murray and Jokic have things to prove and not overconfident and it shows in their game you can always tell when a player isnt practicing because his shots are just a little bit  off  and their stamina is down and the superstars get away with it because they're superstars but they paid the price this yearIt’s crazy how doc rivers is still a coach with the amount of superstar history and such little success he’s had.honestly that was the biggest choke-job i've personally ever seen in my life. wow. never seen a team choke that hard. crazyThat guilty expression on his face like he was in the defendant's stand😂😂😂Some months later: Kawhi at the press conference in Toronto: I‘m back 😂😂😂He is humble, that's most important thing.
Come back next year, it's not the end of the world.Love this guy ! Humble no excuses gives credit to the opposition.If he stayed on the raptors he would be going to the finals with lebronImagine have a 19 pt lead in game 5 up 3-1. Well done Nuggets.He brought up an important point, chemistry.  That is why the Lakers are playing how they are right now. Everyone is having fun, getting stops, pushing up the ball. I was hoping to have LA VS LA in the WC finals but I guess it's going to be nuggets. Lakers in 5 😁It was hard to hear what he was saying, but I think it was something like:
" I left Toronto for this shit ?!  "I still give him respect for not having joined the Lakers to form the next mega-superteam to replace the Warriors. Going out on your own is tough. The NBA is better off because of the choice he made last summer.Kwahi thank you for post match press..I think some great points you bring up. You were good sport in giving Denver it's due credit - salute you and yet calling out area you can improve, and lessons you learnt. Talking about lessons learnt I think one lesson to learn is to find the balance between load management and how to play consistently to ensure energy, chemistry is created. It's obvious load management is counter productive to creating chemistry. Something to hink about 🤔Kawhi: I’m the terminator

Jokic: let’s put a smile on that faceYou’re still my idol kawhi, such a kind person and so humble..Everyone wants to wear the crown until they see how heavy it is.It happens kawhi. Keep ya head up. Congrats nuggets 🤟Kawhi Leonard still my favorite player🏀

This loss don't change a thing🌟Champ choked for the first time and as a Kawhi fan for a while now, it caught me off guard. Nevertheless, come back strong next season king! 👑So much for “The battle of LA” 😂😂😂He'll be fine..he just needs to update his  chip in the off-seasonThe guy still has 4-5 solid years in his career. He can still win 1 chip for the Clippers. Keep your head up Kawhi. You still a GSounds like a true champ, no excuses.Anyone else notice how much older he looks this year then he did last year when he was on the Raptors. Jheez mans is stressed over there in LARaps needed him, and he needed themlooks like Kawhi needed the Raptors just as much as the Raptors needed himDon't be down Kawhi. Chin up. You are one of the greatest player I've ever seen. 💯❤🙏Dude won a championship, had loyal and hard working teammates with the best fan base standing behind him. Leaves and is now out in the second round.They blew a 3-1 lead and their team is so deep, im speechless.Jazz: We up 3-1.
Clippers: We up 3-1.

Nuggets: Hold my beer.
Warriors: How does it feel?One thing is for sure, don't blame it on Kawhi. He made it all. On the offensive end and defensive end. I think the the coach has the most responsibility since Doc haven't done any adjustments given that Clippers have already the puzzle out to close out strong against them. We need to understand that when it comes to the playoffs, it becomes a chess match and not just pure skills. I will forever be a Kawhi fan. Such a humble man.Lets take a moment to remember Doc Rivers. The first coach to lose 3 times going up 3-1 in a seriesFrom 1:3 to 3:3 the confidence is on Nuggets sides.Much respect to the clips despite what happened. I wanted to see a LAL and LAC series. LAL for life. Clips just couldn't get it together.As a raptor fan I will always have the greatest respect for Kawhi. This man was the king of the north, the whole country begged him to stay, he was offered to live here rent free, food free and drama free playing with a championship team almost guaranteed to go back to back had he stayed. With Uncle Dennis' help he said "Nah let me go team up with a certified chocker and try to be the king of LA". Terrible move.Much respect to Kawhi he is still a winner. Don't sleep on him he will come back ✋Im still not able to believe watching it. I watched it on mute and i really enjoyed it. Wow. They are the best team. playing with confidence and playing that knows how to play great basketball. Im gonna say it again, Wow! Jokic are not shooting the basketball. He is passing the ball. So unselfish, that is basketball, and that is how to win the basketball game. Good luck with the Lakers. Im sure I will enjoy it. God bless!Toronto and Kawhi didn’t advance past the 2nd round. Kawhi needed the Raps as much as the Raps needed him.I love how he stay even kill through wins and loses. You’ll be back champThey hyped the Clippers all season long this literally feels like an alternate reality 💀I believe that if Kawhi had stayed in Toronto,  he would be back to the NBA Finals to defend the title. The rest of the Raptors stepped up their game this season to have complimented him and the chemistry is much better. The Raptors didn’t mind Kawhi’s load management, in fact they started it for him. Back in January 2020, there was even a news article that said “Some Clippers Players Reportedly Not Happy About Preferential Treatment for Kawhi Leonard and Paul George”. So yes, Clippers have some chemistry issue.With all due respect to Kawhi I love how this proves you still need a quality supporting cast to win it all, it’s a shame Kawhi had to be such a home sick athlete. He threw away a dynasty. Poetic justice I suppose.Jammal Murray and the Nuggets is the meaning of never give up, 2 series they're down 3-1 but still able to win.Kawhi really left the Raptors to play with Pandemic P 💀Kawhi you’re my favorite player along with Steph, but you came up short tonight. You didn’t show up. Neither did PG. No excuses. But let this motivate you to come back strong next year 💪Very humble always humble kawhi good attitude bro next time we love youNot sure what hurts more, the fact that he left his former championship team or the fact that he lost vs. Denver being up 3-1 in the 2nd round with his new team. Tough for Kawhi.Kawhi: “we shot ourselves in the foot”
Nah bro you woulda missed 😂🤣My man was the king of the Eastern Conference and would've made the finals a lot just by default! He made a bad decision leaving Toronto, and I hope he FINALLY feels heat from the critics. They dodge him because he's the quiet guy.Imagine Making a team just to beat Lakers and lose to the Nuggets. 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂Clippers fans blaming Doc for the loss lmao, your team had no heart. Glad the nuggets won. Wont ever forget Beverly laughing from the bench at the beginning of the series.  Enjoy your W Nuggets!Big respects for u Kawhi 🙂Respect to Kawhi LeonardOne of the most miserable moments in season 2020. Denver got the concentration in game 7 😤He played great other then this game, sad that people are calling him overrated because he played bad 1 game, it was very important but he was great vs the nuggets and carried themAll I wanna see is Patrick Beverlys post game interviewAwww....I feel so bad for him ;( even though I’m a massive lebron fan you can tell he wants to achieve more greatnessA PRIME EXAMPLE OF WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE POSITION, AND END UP COMPLAINING THEMSELVES INTO A WORST POSITION. LEONARD SHOULD'VE CAME TO THE LAKERS! IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LEGENDARY THING TO DO. GO LAKERS!!!Kawhi's face at 5:55 when someone starts their construction project for whatever reason 😂I’m a huge Laker fan and I wanted to watch this and gloat but this dude is such a nice guy... I ended up feeling bad for him...Kawhi ready to go home. We’ll be back next season. Hopefully with new coach and some playersWe learned that chemistry is key to winning today.This guy is just a system superstar. Without a floor general like Lowry, he is just a high level all star who can do everything except playmake.He left Toronto and a chance of a dynasty for pandemic P 😭I feel bad for the man. He’s getting blamed and a lot of hate. Let him rest. He did what he could in a team that’s all bark and no bite.Clippers: we WILL NOT lose to the lakers

Nuggets: 😂😂Is there a scenario that if kawhi went to the clippers and not get pg and keeps sga and gallow? I think that’s a better look of a team because that team looked real fluid and when they faced Gsw we saw that they need one go to guy. What could’ve been.Imagine if this happened to LBJ
Damn I can't imagine how much scrutiny he'll receive.
Y'all gotta hold Kawhi to the same standards as LBJ since majority of y'all claimed he is better than LeBronKawhi knows in his heart that he could have made it easy on himself by joining the Lakers. Anyway he chose the Clippers of all teams. Also asked for George who appear to be injured. It’s the choices you make that you have to live with.Kawhi Chose his own FATE!!💯🔥I feel like this man is gonna reek havoc next post seasonHe said he left the Raptors to spend more time with his family.  I guess this is what he meant!I know in the back of his mind he wish he ain't left Toronto🤣Can’t hate Kawhi. He’s a good dude. I can hate the clippers and his “fans” thoKawhi not looking invincible anymore all of a sudden. His move leaving sas was controversial but was redeemed by winning a chip. I honestly believed him winning another chip in another team would really cement him as one of the greats, pretty sad to see them go down like this.It hurts seeing kawhi lose. To me he’s the best on the planet when he’s in condition and in rhythm. I know a lot of ppl are going to disagree after his performance but I think this clippers team never played to their full potential.If y’all didn’t know the clippers were one of the teams that voted not to continue the bubble after the incident that happened , so it’s not surprising to see how much they gave upJust a all star player who can have super star momentsImagine not getting further than the team you left. Shoulda stay in the east and ran it up with Toronto.Kawhi must have been happy the way he playedI don’t care what y’all gotta say, but I’m honestly impressed by the Clippers. First season to try to gel together wasn’t easy. PG wasn’t even 💯 healthy to start off the season and Kawhi was load managing meaning no consistency. Making the second round and against a team that’s played together for a couple seasons is ‘SUCCESS IS COMING’. This season/year has been a roller coaster. Wait til things get back to normalThis might be late. But Kawhi keep your head up my G! It's darkest before Dawn. Sunny days wouldn't be so special if it wasn't for rain, and joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain. With those words, please find comfort. Regroup and try harder and smarter next season. I believe you can do it. Use all of this hate as fuel to get better and prove every hater wrong. I hope you see this. All the best King. 🏆✊He could be a super hero in Canada. No just in the team. 🇨🇦In a loss to send him Kawhi speaks more than he does in a wind . I respect that he wasn't tight lipped  .he's taking his medicine like a man ...just get betterKawhi you will get up and come big next season, you were the only decent player in this Clipper team in the PO's same love my man!Thank you Kawhi. You’ll be backKawahi rocking the championship win load management approach at his careerAgree guys nobody expected they will blow 3-1 but we all silently waited for itI know Kawhi chose to put himself in this situation but I still feel bad for him :( wish he stayed in Toronto.

Hope the Clippers make some changes and he's able to bounce back next year with a team that has its shit more together than this one.This is a humbling lesson for them bc they thought they were all that, and they lost, but i think next year there gonna comeback with a vengeance, i still have faith in them, this was just a lesson to learn, don't think too much of yourself.Adam is definitely that one guy you want around for some good laughs lolJimmy failed in 5th grade maths test  but won $10,000 by calculating the spin lolok but are we gonna talk about how jimmy calculated that spin so well lmaoMrBro is a legend but some people don’t know it yet.Love you and your brothers efforts to make such helpful and great content for us to watch and get us entertained, thanks broCan we all just appreciate the fact that Mr bro never disappoint us with his contentThe fact one of his friend‘s name is Jimmy 😂Whenever he mentioned Jimmy I thought he was talking about his brother, lolThe main reason I watch this again is because of Adam his energy hype everyoneNo one actually knows how underated mrbro isYou and your brother come up with the best material honestly I hope to eventually get a chance at a challenge with you bothMrBro, MrBeast, and MrCheap shall all unite one dayThat was hilarious and also the fact he calculated that spin is goldThe fact that jimmy actually calculated the spin lolLet’s go!

Music Stuff
- Hire Pete Best (this kid is going places)
-Lead-line the studio
-hire one woman
-invent jazzI love every sketch your dad is in
1000% betterI'm a music teacher for kids K-8 in school, and the middle school and I literally did a listening activity with this very chord progression which resulted in them asking "why did they only write one song in the 50s" lmaoI gotta be honest, I'm a real sucker for the Doo wop chord progression, it's just nice manPaper: Says C, Am, G, F,

Gus: Plays C, Am, F, G,

Me: YesIt took me a bit to realize this was infact Gus' dad and not Sven in old man makeup.And the songs still slap like my dad when he comes home drunkMan this guy plays piano, plays guitar, is Imbiamba Jones, an single-handedly brought down a corporate Jalapeno scam. He really is a Gus of all trades.It is insane how amazing Gus's dad is in every g-dang video he makes an appearance inThat progression is so good, 70 years later, it's starring in a popular youtube video.Still 1000x better than like 90% of music todayThe fact that he played the wrong progression, and not the written one, makes it even betterIm always happy to see Gus's father, he really does good roleplay in those videos. And just seems like a good man.Your dad looks like he could be a star in major motion pictures. He's just got the look.I love when the Johnson parents are in videos they always do such a good jobi just found this channel but i’m in love with both the skits and the longer videos this is a goldminei love how your dad is just supportive and amazingHowever did you manage to drag your dad into this 🤣, i love it you two are great togetherDamn gus’ costumes are getting more realistic each videoI never get tired of that chord progression, 50s music is amazingI've participated in a number of 50s rock tribute albums, so I felt this deep.The Beatles coming along in the 1960s like: "Let's just take a bunch of acid then try to incorporate Eastern musical instruments into our songs."Hey Gus, I don't know why, but just wanted to tell you that your outro song always makes me smile. Ofc you too, thank you for the amazing content :)I love how his dad delivers that last line, really gets me 😂The fact that the chord progression is wrong on that sheet of paper gave me a chuckle.I'll be honest, I wasn't really on board when Gus grew the mustache, but 0:22 just won me over.  That's pure comedy mustache.I love seeing your family in your sketches.What I wanna know is whether Gus’s dad invented Jazz yet or if it’s still on his to-do listI think the purpose of this video was to show that back in the 50's, accuracy didn't matter as long as heart was in it and autotune wasn't.  He nailed it.Love that you didn't even play the progression on the paperI love the To-Do list in the beginning:

"MUSIC STUFF"
- Hire Pete Best (this kid is goin' places!)
- Lead-Line the studio
- Hire one woman
- Invent JazzCrazy how Gus travelled forward in time just to make a video with his old selfduring my 50s music phase I made a list of dozens of songs with those chords. literally dozensYour dad’s delivery is unmatched. Eddy should probably set up his gameYour parents are the best. Hella nice of them to help with your videos.It's very funny how well Gus' dad fits into the Gus Johnson Cinematic UniverseI fully embrace Dad Johnson into the Gus Johnson Cinematic UniverseThere's something about that chord progression that seems to characterize the the attitude of the 50s perfectly.Despite 50's being in my top 2 decades of music, I find this hilarious 🤣
Specifically, "Earth Angel - The Penguins" come to mind 🙂The funniest part is that the cord progression is wrong... he plays C, Am, F, G 😂I love how alike you, your father, and Sven lookThe fact that he actually played the piano is amazingCant believe Gus was actually able to get THE nostalgia critic on the show. You gotta love it.As an enjoyer of 50's music, I can defiantly say this is trueSven's makeup keeps getting better and better. I really believed he was your dad.Glad you talked your dad into being in more skitshis dad's acting style is so similar to his I love itI like how nothings changed about this over the years EXCEPT for the instruments used.I'm still surprised how Gus still looks older than his father.Whenever I was in elementary school, it was these songs that made me think each decade had one progression that all musicians were supposed to use.  

Now that I say that I realize that’s essentially the case for some other decades...Even on the less stressful videos the imposition of your credits music is a welcome reprieveI'm glad that Dad Johnson is showing up in more sketchesI've said something along the lines of this myself. Music is like spawning on a new world and staking your territory. The problem is, most people spawn in a similar place. So, sure back then they were breaking all kinds of new ground, but that's only because no one else had laid claim to those places. Now, modern kids have to travel for miles to find somewhere that hasn't been done to death.And they did stick with itbecause for some reason people couldn't get enough of itSo nice of you to use your homeless uncle in your bits, i feel like it really means a lot to him"Alright well we still need lyrics"
"No problem, I thought long and hard about this. It's about, get this, the singer missing their loved one. But make sure they say that they're "blue". And then also mention the moon. It's important."There are literally hundreds of songs that use that progression. There's even a wiki for it that contains a list of all the songs that use it. Just search "'50s progression" into Wikipedia and it should come up.1st: This is amazing.  There could be a version of this for most eras.
2nd: Thank you Gus.
3rd: Anyone notice that he switched the F and G chord around?
4th: This is comedy gold.  Thank you Gus.You pull me out of my depression slumps and I love you for that.I love when he adds his parents into  sketches, it's awesome how supportive his family is.Sven can really pull off that glasses and beard look.This song is amazing the best part about it is it doesn't change chords.The moment i heard the background intro being just a simple standard tuning. I understood this would be a work of art.That’s one spicy cord progression! Still better than most music out there today. LolGus's dad has the same intonation as Gus and Sven, it's uncannyCongrats on playing the piano and your dad being there Gus, we’re all very proud!I genuinely love  every one of his videos lolAs someone who works in an assisted living facility I felt this in my SOULYour dad needs to help you make a sketch of every era of music.I love that you’re the only one on smosh (when you’re a guest) that actually knows how to play the freakin prop piano. Also rip your legacy of not laughing. Shane totally cheated. He deserves a dishonorable discharge from the sassy leg brigade.One silver lining of this Pandemic has been Gus's dad appearing in more sketches with SvenFor those who’s curious, he’s writing
“- HIRE PETE BEST (this kid is goin’ places!)
LEAD-LINE THE STUDIO
-HIRE ONE WOMAN
-INVENT JAZZ” at 0:02I absolutely love his caption 🤣❤
Keep on being you forever Gusas someone who is currently in the 1950's, I can agree this is how all the songs areI'm from Germany and fell in love with the Ink Spots thanks to Fallout NV.
This is on point! Every song is basically the same, at least the intros.
And I love it!This guy is too talented, I can'tI love how the chords he plays don't even match the order on the paperYour dad makes the sketches 10x better than they are and they're already at a 10this hurts me as I love 50s music, yet its so trueI love how those chords are just most of “Earth Angel.”Thank you Gus Johnson. That is in fact how they wrote songs in the 50s.it's actually crazy how many genes your dad inherited from SvenFor those wondering what the paper his dad's writing on says:
"Music Stuff:
-Hire Pete Best
(this kid is going places!)
-Lead-Line the studio
-Hire one woman
-Invent Jazz"Don't forget the 12 bar blues. I hear so many songs from around the 50s using that progression or a variation of itIt’s funny because immediately after seeing this, a few 50s songs came into my head. Means this is totally accurate.I wonder how long it actually took Gus to lead that on the pianoFor anyone wondering what he was writing,here you go:

Music Stuff

MUSIC STUFF
-Hire Pete Best
(this kid is going places!)
-Lead-line the studio
-Hire one woman
-Invent jazzNow we have videos on 70s and 50s music. Can't wait for the other decadesWell you played that cord progression beautifully!!And that's why we all love 50s musicNow Gus, just do the same exact skit but with an acoustic guitar, country music, and the early 90s and it’ll work trust me.You forgot the part about falling in love with a 13 year old.If Gus isn't on SNL one day, I'll be shocked! He's very creative, a great character actor, & actually funny!Gus is just accurate on everythingI grew up listening to oldies stations. Every time I hear them, it reminds be of being driven around in a 1989 Chrysler town and countryBut wait he played F before G. He’s ahead of his time and doesn’t even know it.The fact that your dad just draws lines on the paper without even writing makes this sketch perfect"I'll prolly just stick with this for the next ten years" that had me wheezingI love 50s 60s music the simple piano gives me hope lolThe first 4 chords you learn on any instrument and you're an instant camp counselor.not sure about your dads acting skills but he has very satisfying enunciation here.. maybe its the sound guy but i love his lines lolAll his music videos are always bangers, can’t say I’ve ever heard or seen a bad Gus Johnson music based video.Love the notes that Dad is writing down 🤣The man the myth the legend known as Gus's father makes a rare appearanceThe more dad like Gus Johnson becomes, the more child like Dad Johnson becomes.Amazing how real the old man filter looks on Sven in this videoI fear the man who has practiced one chord progression 1000 times more than the man who has practiced 1000 chord progressions onceAre we just supposed to ignore the fact that he's playing C Am F G? lmaoI'm pleased to report that back in the fifties, record labels were working to "lead line the strings" and "hire one woman." (0:02) clearly a step in the right direction.Definitely can’t say any different for today’s music!Same thing happened to the first person to write the piano phrases for a Wedding. Hundreds of years later and look where we are atYou are clearly breaking YouTube algorithms of video length. Good work!Hey now, there was a lot of good music in the 50s and early 60s.No one's gonna point out that he didn't even write the chords right?😂😂 Should be F, G, not G, F😂😂Gus' dad somehow looks younger than he ever has beforeAn accurate representation of the human mind trying to do something newAs someone who works at Universal Music Group, I can 100% confirm the accuracy of this video and the repetitiveness of all mainstream tracks.This specific video really highlights how much Sven looks like his dad oh myI love how the last two chords are switched 😆Gus’s dad is writing
Music stuff
-Hire Pete Best
(This kid is going places)
-Lead-Line the Studio
-Hire One Woman
-Invent Jazzlead-line the studio, hire one woman, invent jazz?? damn this studio sounds great!When dad’s involved you know it’ll be a good videoIt’s crazy how much Sven looks like your dad, damni sometimes wonder how many songwriters and musicians of the underground scenes we just don't know abt bc they weren't around for cassette tapes and the internet... talking 20s-70s roughly. there's not a doubt in my mind that people were out there making experimental and progressive music. it just wasn't shared, or if it was, wasn't recorded, or if it was, not preserved, or if it was, probably archived and difficult to access outside of academic study...Lol I love that he actually played Bb-Gm-Eb-F, which wouldn't be the same as C-Am-G-F even if you transposed itBehold, the multi-talented shape-shifting comedic mastermind Gus JohnsonWow Sven looks just like a younger version of his dad!God bless Gus Johnson. What a treasure.After this video I went to the Apple Music 50s playlist and pressed shuffle. I got a song called “The Crystal Lake” that immediately fit that chord progression. Dang.it probably took some time to actually learn those notes, good job!And yet it was somehow better than modern musicWhen you realize that he plays a different chord order than what's written on the paperA guy I used to work with played the best of Chuck Berry one time and you know that opening guitar riff of Johnny B. Goode? Pretty much every song began with it.That chord progression sure is swellTen years? Those chords are still being used for like half of all the pop songs.Gus you should really do a old timeys piano song, I mean the short clip sounded fairly good so why not an extra minute or two.The set designers are amazing i really thought i was watching a 50s record lableThis is actual footage of Gus as a young man in the 50’sNow the target audience for this joke is probably a bit smaller than for your other stuff, which might result in fewer views and likes overall. But don't for a second let that discourage you from putting your dad in more of your videos. Or any of your family members for that matter. You are all obviously a very artistically talented bunch. I doubt that it's only the male part of your family. Keep it up 👍your dads voice is just perfect for thisI'm convinced there dad is just Sven from the future. Uncanny resemblance.In case anybody missed it his dad was writing

-Hire Pete Best. (this kid is going places.) 
-Lead-line the walls. 
-Hire one woman. 
-Invent jazz.I love how this got #50 on trendingHaha yeah that goes for the pop music of the 50s, but not for the amazing jazz musicians who kept composing through the 50s! Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane and Dizzy Gillespie.. to name a fewdaddy johnson is the unsung hero we didnt know we all needed.That’s a swell tune! 

Now we just need some lyrics about holding hands with your best gal.Well, you could also use a 12-bar blues progression, OR if you play the tune "Let's Go to the Hop," you get to swap between the two from verse to chorus!The notes on the paper in front of your dad are hilarious! "hire pete best" "hire one woman"kudos to Gus's dad for writing with pen when the tip is retractedThis is pretty much how they wrote songs in the 50’sLets be honest, depending on your choice of music, you could say nothing has changed.When you played those chords my mind sang all of the 50s songs i know  at the same timeI know you don’t do request, but I think it would be pretty funny if you did a sketch about how Jack Stauber wrote his songsNow I kinda miss the sit down episodes where you had your keyboard - Still got a solid laugh out of me though.I like a lot of your little gems; this is one such one. 👍🏻👍🏻“I miss back in the day, when musicians had skill”This is a totally realistic 50s record label. We can tell because it has a a sign that says “50s Record Label”.I’m unreasonably mad that G and F are in reverse orderYour dads acting is amazingIt's the notes you DON'T hear that makes 50s music special.This list is killing me🤣

🤣🤣🤣60 years later, *it’s still the same chords.*He needed to learn this entire chord just for this skitEvery 50s song sounds almost exactly the same and I find comfort in thatyour dad looks so much like sven that i’m starting to think they’re relatedThis is the first time I hear Dad Johnson's voice!  😢❤️0:09 Someone submit this man for an oscar. Holy friggin shit.Is it any different from normal pop songs nowadays 😂I paused and read what Gus's Dad was writing, and wasn't disappointed.Your dad is an amazing actor!I think it’s interesting how Gus’ dad appears to be both Sam Rockwell and Dana CarveyI mean your not wrong, but it’s still better than most music now daysidk if gus will see this but you literally look like my bestie, you're his doppelganger.   and thanks for making me laugh at my worst^^They really squeezed every dollar out of that progression before moving onThe “hire one woman” and “invent jazz” in the notes 😆👌🏽I always point this out to new people I meet.

I'm glad someone else picked up on this.I heard a joke 20+ years ago "In the fifties, we had 4-chord songs, in the sixties, we had 3-chord songs, in the seventies, we had 2-chord songs, in the eighties, we had 1-chord songs, and now songs have no chords at all."It is surreal how much Sven and Daddy Johnson look alikeI like 50s music.  This one has potential.The record executive's to do list says

Tbh, I LOVE Touch Bar. I’m just a little bit sad of seeing this year’s MacBook without it.I had ordered the 16 with M1 Pro based on the fact that it had the same CPU performance as the M1 Max but then I watched the presentation again and realized the M1 Max has more video encoders…so I switched to a 14 with M1 Max. No more waiting on video encoding hurrah!I’m pretty sure you made a small mistake, the AirPods Pro ARE sweat and water resistant too, not just the new 3rd gen regular AirPods1080p camera it's sooo vintage. I love it. It reminds me about my first webcam I bought 10 years ago for $20. Apple finally installed it.Nice content!
I would like to see how the new macbook pro performs in programming. Web development, ios development, etc.Baffling how divisive the notch is. They just extended the display upwards and the cam/notch cuts into it, in an area previously unused except for the menubar. However, it seems people would rather have the current setup, with a bigger top bezel 'hiding' the camera system, even it means less real estate. But to each their own.somehow I have the feeling that someone in development is responsible for strange things for the MacBooks Pro. First the TouchBar, now the notch. This feels like FaceID was planned but for some reason it wasn't in time.And 5 years later at keynote, "we have reduced the notch by 30%......."
10 years later " we have completely redesign the machine, no notch"......Quite a lot of information in a 7 minute video. Nice editing by the way. 👍🏻I was excited for the MacBook Pro which is $2,999 in Australia but I think I’m getting the M1 MacBook Air this year for uni. It’s way more cheaper, ($1,349) great performance as well plus I can get a new phone since I currently have a MacBook Air 2017 and IPhone 8+Thank you Dan, always go to you for my keynote summariesPlease do gaming comparisons for some AAA titles, and on windows if possible. Test out those GPU cores for 14” base model vs higher models/M1 model/windows gaming laptops!!!!!How many performance cores will be there in 14 inch lower end MacBook pro with 8 core cpu?I think ill finally be upgrading to the 14" MBP after years of waiting. just wish it had USB-A instead of HDMI.I would've guessed Face ID would've been in the notch. Makes sense with all that empty space in the notch120hz and the faster chips were the only 2 things I wanted, the notch really kills it for me and it seems unlikely that we will have a notchless design for quite a long time. really unfortunateI honestly don’t understand why the notch is such a big deal to everyone, it’s never bothered me.Will there be an Apple Event in November showcasing the MacBook Air and the iPad Air? or any other products?One thing I’d like in your review video is to just see a 14in next to the 13 in to visually see the size difference.due to incompatibility issues i wanted intel processors on some versions of the new macbook pro.The notch serves two purposes. One, it allows the top bezel to be tiny. Two, it makes up for losing the MacBook Pro branding on the bottom bezel, which is now on the bottom. Now anyone can look at it from the front and know it’s a Mac.Which Macbook pro 16 inch is best for a graphic designer - and which configuration?This tells me not to buy a iphone or ipad until next year as they have (finally) improved battery lifeI want to know more about the keyboard. I have the first gen of the MBP with touchbar and it's a first to get some keys to register.Maybe this is an unpopular opinion but I didn’t mind the Touch Bar, kind of sad they got rid of it. Like I get it wasn’t useful all the time but it’s not something I hated.Just ordered the base model 16 in macbook pro with 512 gb, excited as I currently have a 2015 15 in Macbook Pro!Excelent video!
FINALLY they've re-added connections, no more stupid dongles... and bye bye touch screen we won't miss you.
These are great improvements over the bad design decisions of last few years. So thanks apple for fixing your own errors and sell them as improvements! hah
And of course, the new chips and new screen! awesome!
Overall, I'll probably go for a 14" m1 proI love my M1Macbook Air, but I am a wee jelly. I’m excited for the future of the MacBook 😎Now it only needs a USB Type A port and this thing can finally be used in the real world again.So we have been asking to get rid of notches from the iPhone for ages  so Apple responds by giving us more notches .I want the new MacBook but the entry level 16” is $3500 here in Sweden. Same with the advertised 14” 10/16 coreWhat’s absurd about the notch is that there’s no Face ID. They added that in just for the sake of better quality when doing face time.is there any rumours on a mac mini upgrade with new gen silicon ?I'm happy about the Notch. Middle of the menu bar is the least used space on my Mac, so camera in the notch simply means more pixels. Nothing to hate here.Calling it now, the Mac Pro is going to get an M1 Pro MaxI want a 27 or bigger imac announed, and more ports please! A newer Mac mini would be nice and how about giving us back changeable ram slots that i can add later instead of when i buy it new!If it comes to more screen and having a notch vs them dropping it down to meet the camera I’d rather have the notch being I never use that top area anywayFirst full-height function row key *EVER* in an Apple laptop!Beautifully compressed.Which is the best value version?They should have kept the Touch Bar. A standard keyboard is a thing of the past!New AirPods: I wonder if they still cause the in-ear allergic reaction of the last AirPod Pros. I just gave mine away because less than 1 hour of use causes 2 days of itchy ears and leaky fluids from my ears. Ridiculous in this day and age. And I have lots of IEMs and have never had this issue with any other product including the 1st generation AirPods.That notch is annoying AF. Other cell phone makers are getting _RID_ of the notch in their phones, even Apple reduced it (although didn't get rid of it completely as I hoped) in the 13, but then they go and *INTRODUCE* it in the Mac lineup?

SMDH.

The screen still has a huge bezel on the bottom. How about we just move the stuff from the bottom to the top to go on either side of the camera, and erase the _bottom_ bezel?That MacBook Pro is still sick. I mean really in macOS that center where the notch is isn’t really used.They really took it up a NOTCH by selling M1 MAX MACSI ordered mine already it already says preparing for shipment I’m so excited 😍😊"hey siri-play music" subscription is outside the universe hilariousGOD DAMNIT where is the new Mac Mini we've all been waiting for --- for a year now!  :(Can I still use any of the USB-C ports for charging?

I know how many people like to have a charger sitting at their desk and another one to take with them. It would be great not having to purchase a second MagSafe charger.Airpods 4 “reintroducing rubber ends to custom fit any ear” they can never just stick to something, i know more people who say they can’t fit into the 1st and 2nd airpodsIs the base of the new MacBook Pro thicker because of all the ports?Will there be a Nov event? I want these chips in a Mac MiniWhich is best for video editing imac or macbook pro? Suggest me pleaseI swear, that Notch better be there for Face ID.What ever happened to the 27 inch Imac?New Macbook pros are too expensive!! Definitely "PRO" though. The notch is funny, but it's within the menu bar so I don't see it that obstructive.Watch the Apple Event and pay attention on Tim Cook during his presentations how he always bends his left knee when starting a new sentence. Hilarious :'D1:55 But the AirPods Pro ARE sweat and water resistant. Both are IPX4.7 minutes? I feel like this could be done in 7 sentences!Wow .. a notch 😳according to Apple's scale, 32 core GPU of M1 Max is almost 5700XT desktop version level of perf. Tho measly 10 CPU cores is a major disappointment.Damn, watching and typing this on my M1 MacBook Air and I think I'll stick with the Air.  Having said that, these are probably a godsend to heavy multimedia users.  I don't see why anyone who is not in a multimedia profession should get one tho.  The M1 Air and 13 inch M1 Pro are more than enough for a casual looking for an amazing laptop (and guess what, even those hobbyists who like to make music or do photo/video editing would be amazed with the base M1 MacBooks, no need for these monsters they just announced, save the money).  I really think these new models are for rich white suburban trendy kids who think they are going to be a music "producer" or for actual multimedia professionals.  Everyone else can stick with the basic M1 MacBooks (air or pro are fine).Wait one year and you will have the same config for 1000$ cheaper , that’s What hapenned with the MacBook Air last yearThe notch doesn’t bother me, it’s where the finder bar will be anywaysWhy did they get rid of the touch bar?No iMac style new colors? Pity. Not a fan of the notch either. Apart from these two things, they look like good machines I will never be able to afford. Thanks for the news.Seems like Samsung and other manufactures are the new innovative companies that apple use to be when Jobs was around. If apple unveiled notchless screens, foldable phones and MacBook pros with touch screens people would go bizerk.well In india the same base model Macbook is 2600 USD.... damnCongrats to Apple on another successful event. None of these features are interesting to me. Isn't the home pod just a device to spy on you? LOL!
I really think the Apple Music $4.99 voice plan is absurd. We already pay a lot of money for Apple Music, so another cost is not acceptable.Wonder if M1 max can gameSo, they got rid of the idiot touch bar AND they added an SD card port back? There's the two reasons I still have a 2011 on my desk (an SSD really breaths life into older Macs)...Didn’t the original AirPod pro’s case already support MagSafe?Still gonna wait for m2 chipDo a multiple broswer tab test. Specifically Safari vs Edge. I found that Edge has been much more smoother with having a bunch of grouped tabs open and it saves on the RAM. Safari uses 1 gb of memory just by opening it on the 2020 MBP 13 M1 16gb.What I want is a MacBook Air with a M1 MaxTaking away a basic feature with our built in assistant and native music app that we’ve had forever just to introduce a “revolutionary” new subscription to literally profit off of our voice. 

Got it.Does ANYBODY on this thread know IF you CAN buy AppleCare coverage for the AirPods 3 AFTER you get them OR you have to buy AppleCare RIGHT WHEN YOU BUY the AirPods 3?

I’m looking to UPGRADEFor it to be everything we wanted their would have been the bigger iMacThe notch is the downgrade I’m sure EVERYONE would rather little more bezel over NOTCH.Did Apple forget to launch Mac Mini M1X?So now we need to have a subscription to play songs through siri!The notch design is genius! They made the bezels smaller, moved up the menu bar into that area giving us more actual useable screen real estate. The area where the notch is has never been used by the menu bar, it was just wasted space. So now we get more screen to use and it wont affect games or movies or anything that is full screen.Thanks for the information.Okay, it is perfect for my tasks of viewing video content like on DVDs, viewing and writing emails, viewing YouTube and doing social media on Twitter?  Listening to streaming music too! Seems to have enough power to keep up with my lifestyle!  Of course buy the top of line specs but only 1 TB of storage, 32 core GPU, 64 GB RAM, 16" screen size!Everything we wanted?  (he asked, sad that they did not announce a pro mac mini)Nothing was offered unless you get excited about ports something every other laptop has and a touch screen,  5G or LTE,  360 with handwriting notes on contents.  Plus, today's laptops 💻  do all that a under 3lbs, many barely weighing 2lbs.Its way too expensive... I waited for a year for the launch now another year to get the price down. WowFor some reason I like the notchwhat about mac mini? why they left itI do not own a power brick with USB-C port.  Can I using my 2018 iPad Pro power brick with USB-A and lightning cable to charge them?"we eliminated all the dumb sh$t we did over the last 7 years."  bravoJust ordered a 16 inch really excitedWaiting for the MacBook Air Pro ….Apple we have now Promotion that can change Herz depending on the task 😲 and we are the first ones to develop this technology , Nvidia and AMD Radeon with GSync and FreeSync 🤦‍♂️We got everything we wanted… um who are you speaking for because I’m still waiting for iMac Pro….Waiting for the micbook air pro...Can you still use your old magsafe 2?I wanted the AirPods Pro 2!I wanted more in this event but okOk um I do want to see the feet of the new MBP. They look changed in the promo pictures but we haven't seen what they look like from the bottom!THIS WHOLE 24 HOURS PROVED THAT FOOTBALL BELONGS TO FANS WE'RE SO POWERFUL"I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgment, and i don't expect to be forgiven I'm simply here to apologize" John W HenryRespect to John W Henry for owning this and putting out this video. Means a lot to us fans (of all clubs). We all make bad decisions in life, its how we learn best.This guy is running footballThe Liverpool fans forgiving him are genuinely stupid. This is exactly what he wants, you're showing him that he can do whatever he wants. He doesn't care about you, he isn't sorry, he went behind your backs to create a super league, disregarding you as fans completely, and is now apologising purely because he needs to keep his PR up. Don't ever forget what he did, hold him completely accountable, his only goal is to make money, don't ever forgive him.Thank you Henderson for everything. He's showed why he is Captain and why that time under Stevie was paramount to the man and captain he is today. He's turned this round with the players and the fans together. YNWAThe fans won back the sport. Well done everyone involved with getting our game back 👏Hendo and Milli standing behind the Cam with a baseball batI hope these lessons taught you a bit more about football, fandom and the bond at, and around Liverpool, the club, the players, the history and the lovely supporters all around the world! 

Jürgen is just awesome the way He protected the team, the club while still criticising this decision. And Also big kudos to Hendo for being such an awesome captain since we lost our King G. 

I know why I buy a Hendo jersey euch and every Year! 

Kudos also for this apologise. This shows what type of personality you are and that there is still good to believe in. I think we all will never forget, but we can grow with this experience and look forward to support our boys to attack the top Clubs again over the next season.

YNWA ALWAYSFootball is for everyone not just for who has the most money and popularity🙏
❤️YNWA ❤️We all make mistakes. That's part of life. You have done good things for the club in the past 10 years and I hope you continue to do so. You'll never walk alone.-We are proud of you because you are trying with all your passion for the game
- You are forever in the heart of every loyal teammateNever thought a billion dollar owner would have to make a YouTube apology video😂 appreciate that he understands why we were so upset in the first place. YNWA🔴🔴🔴🔴Just remember this guy called you 'legacy fans'. I ain't a Liverpool fan but can assure you Liverpool fans will never forgive or forget this.Respect for apologizing and also for leaving likes and comments on. While the damage this has done is severe it's not irreversible. As long as you learn from this and continue to work at improving our club on and off the pitch we can all put this behind us.Before the “disruption” and after, the best club owner in the pl by far. Thanks for bringing Jürgen and the success we’ve experienced so far since your tenure. Now let’s get some crucial signings done for the coming season😉He's a businessman used to the American Way of doing things, but he forgot the most important thing: THE POWER OF FANS 💪To see the owner of the club coming forward to apologize... this shows how powerful of a manager we have in Klopp, how powerful of a captain we have in Hendo, and how powerful our fans are. YNWA ❤The first owner to apologize the fans without saying a message by typing on social media, but speaking on youtube. Respect from me 🔥🔥👍🏻👍🏻It's not something that will be forgotten but I'm sure we can all appreciate that John had the respect to apologize to everyone publicly. Now we watch as they work to earn our trust again.This apology is not because he has listened. It is because he has lost. We can never forget what he was going to do to this club and to English football.Everyone makes mistakes... You are not alone mr. Henry. Thanks for your sincerely.Honestly I've accepted your apology as one of the greatest human in this world with sense of humour and feeling bad on the hurt players and fans at large. Dear John W. Henry, I sincerely forgive you for your one great mistake in the world of Football. May you leave longThank you for your honest and sincere message with apologies.
We thank you for your work done past decade. This time it was not what we want, but people make mistakes. People can overcome mistakes by further challenges.

Let's walk together to make our club better and better. 

YNWA.Well this is astonishing
He actually apologized
It's a good thing to own up to mistakesThank you for words so sweet.
We're all bound to make mistakes but to listen to advice is divineBravo John Henry takes a man to admit his mistakes.  Keep focused on what's good for the club without forgetting the fans.Watching Monday's match broke my heart. As for the 1st time since I decided to support liverpool as a kid. I didn't care if we won or not. That has never happened in my life and I hope that it never happens again I love supporting liverpool as a local lad it means the world to me knowing that we are one of the best teams in the worldI respect that. Strong speech. Mistakes must be admitted. We'll overcome all the difficulties together! YNWACan't say I've forgiven him but at least he's personally come out with something unlike everyone else and owned up to his mistakes so hopefully we can move forward nowWow, so proud to be Liverpool fans from Indonesia seeing the owner made applologies. I came down im tear of happiness watching this. Really happy.I thank you for your attention over the years, from you taking over and paying off the club's debt to making the team I supported from 2009 to become premiere league champions. I understand your steps as a club owner at ESL, about the advantages and others that make you tempted. and I really respect your decision to dare to apologize in public.Football is like something god created just for us and it is sad when it is mistreated.

From all fans we forgot about our differences and came together to end this terrible moment, respect to all fans.

From LFC FanNow we know where his heart lie! Amazing gesture from the top man. Rebuilt the club from the ground and up, so we’ll forgive you Henry!So proud of us. And I do forgive him. I believe there were some bad intents owners, but I believe as well that some of the owners couldn’t imagine that the ESL was going to be something harmful. The people, the supporters showed it to the chairman, and now he’s listened to our voice and he’s apologizing. YNWAWe all need to remember this man saved our club after the hicks and Gillette disaster, we were hours from going under. So without him, no jurgen, no 6th champions league, no pl title, no vvd no salah no anything. Thank you JohnIn the last 48 hours we showed them our passion for the sport and we proved them that football will never dieWatching the Leeds game on Monday was an empty feeling. A man of his wealth & stature to publicly apologise & take full responsibility for the his mess, takes courage. Humility shows the true nature of a person. Wont be surprised if he visits a few pubs in Liverpool to talk to the people who matter - SUPPORTERS.So proud to be one of this club supporters entire my life.
Thank you so much for making our club be the great again.don’t worry John, we still love you and thank you for what you have done to this club since you came, thank you JohnThank you John. Businessmen do business. He's there to make his investment grow at the end of the day. Sometimes the values of owners and fans don't line up as clearly seen here. You can't get mad at him. You can see exactly where each side is coming from. At the end of the day millions of fans are louder than an owner. The fans had, have and will always have the most control over their respective clubs.This whole mess has shown one huuuuuge positive. All football fans worldwide have shown how passionate they are for the ❤️ of our beautiful game.Everybody deserves a second chance. Up to now the owners have been brilliant.   Takes guts to admit your wrong and it says a lot for me. Time for the club to be as one, no more negativity!  We move on to better days!  YNWANow This Is A Kind Of Accepting The Mistake  Youve Done And Saying Sorry To Your Team And Fans....Respect Man Now You Realise It..Lets Give Him A Big Applause For His Maturity And Kind Hearted Even He Done Mistakes But Still A Red Family And Always A Liverpool Family .....YNWA From MalaysiaAgain, Im so proud to be part of LFC family. I will never let you walk alone, even in this pandemic, our voice still heard. Never in a single doubt that I believe it will happen anyway, such a new format would need many more years to be approved. Might be happening in the future though...Unlike typical nonpologies, he actually said the key words "I am sorry, I made a mistake. Its my fault." That is so uncommon, its unexpected to be sure. Normal nonpologies usually go like "I am sorry you felt like I let you down" or something like that. 
He actually apologized. Up to everyone whether to accept it or not, but Henry puts the blame on himself alone.Respect to Him.. It take Balls for an owner to own his Mistake ..And I appreciate that . We are more than a Football Club ..
Y.N.W.A 💗💗💗In all fairness he is the only owner to come out and give a personal message in a video. Respecti just want to say "THIS IS LIVERPOOL AND THIS MEANS MORE'.  stay safe and healthy. waiting for next season. YNWAThe LFC brand lost much of its authenticity because of this mistake. Rebuilding trust will take time and actions (not just words) and it starts with YOU (Mr. Henry). You have to step up, like you did now, and prove to everyone that you understand the culture and history of this club, and that you’re propagating its mission and message.Wow, almost seems genuine. If the fans didn’t act up he would have gone through with super league anyway knowing exactly what it would mean for football.Respect for Liverpool FC well deservedWow thats from heart not from script.... huge respect 🙌Takes a big man to apologise when they're in the wrong, big respect to one of the individuals that put our club where it is today, onwards and upwards from here, YNWA ❤️As a United fan thank you very much for being the only one to show face and apologise. Just hope everyone follows suit.I never thought he would actually sit down and send us an apology like this and take all the blame for it instead of blame others, so that I appreciate!Even there were no supporters to fill your stadium in every match your club being playing right now,we as a fans are still support our beloved club no matter where we are right now..and that's what supporters all around the world do..coz that is what we do best!!We always do the best as we can to support the club that we loved no matter big or small club there are!!Just dont ever-ever-everrr forget about that to all football club owners all around the world's~Your money cant buy our passion!This time we're forgive you sir and please dont you ever try to walk alone again~😔it's okay to forgive, but it's not okay to forget what has happenedMy respect for him📈📈📈📈📈📈📈This doesn’t earn our trust back but it’s a start. I can at least appreciate that you came out of your hole to face us like a man.Well said Henry! Thank you for being such a responsible owner. Hard to find in current day football management :)A real man right there, takes responsibility for a mistake, explanation, accepted 👍Forgiven But Never Forgotten 🙂No one stands so tall as the person who stoops to apologise, I think it is important that we can all learn from our mistakes, if you can do this then I am willing to forgive. YNWAMASSIVE RESPECT! ✊ 
Anyone who knows who he is and what he’s done for Liverpool will appreciate this apology. 
Thank you John W Henry! 
Thank you Fans for putting him back in line! 
YNWA!!!Atleast he had the balls to address the fan and apologize. Respect🙌It was such a catastrophic decision that, if it went through, I'd have had to contemplate my continued support for LFC - that's how big it was. If you wanted a fans view - ask them before doing it. The last 6 years I've been your biggest fans, with the introduction of Jurgen, and his fantastic signings. I was still a big fan of yours when you misjudged the furlough issue. If you want show you are sorry - you are in Liverpool - so its going to have to be actions, not words. There are alot of clubs out there who are struggling due to coronavirus - maybe try helping them out. I'll give it another go, but its going to be years, for me, until I have a positive opinion of you peeps again. Sadly. YNWAThank you very much Mr.Henry. We all respect all members of LFC, you are the owner mostly we love you as we love Liverpool. You are forgiven and let us move forward with our best Manager in the world. Jurgen Klopp.If only Stan Kroenke had the courage and respectability to do the same for my club, Arsenal. Whilst J.W. Henry has made mistakes, he's helped Liverpool regain their elite status whilst our American has destroyed my club. 😢YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB 🔥Thank you John Henry. Apology accepted. We know the clubs going under major loss because of the pandemic. Wish most of the fans understood the situation that you're in.Big respect for this, could have just put out a generic statement but you can tell he still wants a relationship with the fans👏🏾Class ,,,well done,you've put a wrong,, right, and hopefully restored a faith,trust and respect of our great family LFC,,,,you will never walk alone ,if you walk the right path,,,,,,,It takes a lot to face up and admit the wrong doing, I hope this admission is not empty and is mirrored by actions moving forward. 
Although my love for the Liverpool football club has not been lost, it certainly has damaged my beliefs in the purity of the clubs ethics and this will take a lot more than a statement to rectify.

I wish the club and the organisation all the best in repaying fans, putting football before the money and investing in those that invest so much to LFC. 

YNWAYour apology is accepted by me and I hope y the rest of our fans! You have only to look back over the years you took our club on to see the strides made to get us back to the panicle of football. Where we belong.Thanks John ladI love LIVERPOOL  30 years  !
Thanks to all who supported LIVERPOOL at this difficult minute!  
    NO  TO SUPERLEAGUE.Thank you John for you message. Honest and respected. YNWAThis is better than a tweet. Thank you 🙏Business owners will always have a different relationship with a club than the fans. Great that he apologised and I am quite sure it was a huge lesson learn´t. The club is much bigger than any owner could be. Liverpool has a long and great history. YNWAMad respect for having the balls to apologize.He is a brilliant person.. Strong to take a personal responsibilityEverybody makes mistakes. You learn and move on to the next experience. John W Henry is a respected businessman, pure class. 👏 YNWATrully gentleman, appology accepted! 👏👍🙏🔥Respect for coming out on his own and issuing the apologyIt’s been an incredibly tough year I bought only 4 mega yachts, I hope you understand my position.Thank You John W Henry - respect for saying sorry, and apologizing  - You and the team at Fenway Sports Group have done an awful lot of good for our club, for that and for manning up now, we hear you, we forgive you - YNWAThis is my club's owner!❤Mad respect for Henry, having the humility to own up. He has EARNED his chance to redeem himself, LFC has been highly successful under his/Klopps leadership. I have confidence he will make amends for thisclassic case of: "better to ask for forgiveness than permission"Mad respect for him admitting his fault and apologizing, it takes a real man to do so and we appreciate him but a broken trust is not something that is easy to fix. Just hope the club continues to work in close contact with the fans. Strength in Unity brings growth.ONCE AGAIN COMEBACK STRONGER LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE 💪Have you noticed how he stresses "our work" and "your club". He has a deep passion for the club and he respects the fans. He may have wronged, but it shows a lot of character to come forward and deliver such a message. Does any other principal owner had done so?We do not forgive! We do not forget!Big up, my man. It takes a lot 🙏Respect from Liverpool fans in Brazil, Thanks John.To forgive is divine. But only a fool forgets.He only apologised and withdrew because he realised the amount of hate would make the project not profitable. He doesn’t care about the fans, only that they forced him to stop his lucrative businessAppreciated and accepted. Let it be a blimp that’s soon forgotten and forgiven. Return the game to the fans in the stadiums soon. YNWAYou'll never walk alone, John!Respect for you Mr. Henrywhether or not this was just damage control i can appreciate that he takes all the blame and actually apologised and not just put out a statement but put his face and voice on it too. fans won't forget but this was probably the correct thing to do in this situation.To anyone saying “we won we got our game back” just remember who still runs the game and where the World Cup is. 😂Huge respect ♥️👍I have mixed feelings about it.
People shouldn't be judged after one mistake, but I am afraid, that people that made that decision once will make it again if there's an opportunity.
I am also amazed how the all owners of these clubs thought they could make a decision without discussing it once with their own club, their staff or their fans in particular.Fair play that he has stood up and apologised. I respect him for this.We must accept this, the way he came clean to all the millions of fans. Accept this once and for all. YNWAI love John Henry. Brilliant guyI appreciate his effort for making this video and ACTUALLY apologize in person to us, the fans. Unlike the other club's owners. But Mr. Henry, we would NEVER forget what you did yesterday and we WILL watching you closely this time.forgiven, never forgotten.Liverpool Fans will never forget this, personally i would like him to leave our club. Reading a prewritten apologiy doesnt fix what he has destroyed. Liverpool Fans stay strong together!Respect to the owner well done JohnAt least you have the guts to come up and say things done chin up❤️❤️ Respect from a Barcelona fan🔥🔥He seems very genuine to me. At the end of the day I love this club no matter the owner or where they play I support Liverpool not the league they play in. And let's not forget the prem was stated in the same shady way.At least he's showed up guys. Better than hiding from all this shambleFinally an owner that understands what football means to the fans... hopefully...He is the only owner that is apologizing in all the big teamsEveryone makes mistakes, but now the team must be prepared for the next season and the team must move away from selfishness and work together
 We are liverpool this means moreWith words like that John, you'll never walk alone. Thanks ❤Owners,players and staff On and Off..Real Fans stayed forever..football clubs without fans are nothing..Fair play to him didn’t think he would apologiseAs a man city fan... For some these owners... We can definitely forgive if they shoulder the blame... But we can't forget. There's much more to do.We will support our club, whatever decisions they makeTakes a lot of integrity to hold your hand up , admit your mistake and apologize.  Credit to John Henry for doing this, however, I feel he will need to do a lot more if he wants to get the fans back on board.  As Souness said on SkySports....This ESL proposal wasn't put together over a month.  It's taken years of planning, meetings by these owners.  Meetings that obviously were done behind the backs of the fans and other people at the clubs.  

I believe it is important to forgive in life, not necessarily for the individual at fault, but for our own peace of mind.  There is a huge difference in forgiving, but never forgetting. YNWA ... JFT96DONT WORRY MAN WE FORGIVE YOU. WE LOVE YOU100% respect him for apologizing and owing up to this mess.His choice of words are telling, he understands that he is just the custodian and the club is nothing without the fans.
Fair play.Than you gracias Liverpool FC Youl never walk alone, Nunca caminaras solo ❤️LOVE AND RESPECT TO YOU SIR, ALL THE WAY FROM A FAN IN THE PHILIPPINES. YNWA. UP THE REDS LIVERPOOLWe can only move forward now & move on to the next chapter.The chapter to make our club more stronger & more united.YNWAI'd forgive him. But I'd never forget.Past 48 hours had me questioning everything in Football but at least he has apologized, it’s a start, thank you John ❤️1. I'm glad he accepted that he threw Jurgen and the players under the bus by letting them face the heat for a decision he made.
2. Unlike his decision to join the Super League, the apology was made in public by himself. I appreciate that.
3. His words make his intentions clear, he's not leaving. He wants to mend the fractured relationships not just with the fans, but with Jurgen too.

I believe he's done enough to earn one last chance at rectifying the mess he's created and rebuild the relationships at the club.
We are heading into a crucial post season period. If we can't work together then the opportunity to reclaim our position at the top will slip away. Let's not fight amidst ourselves, abuse one another and distract ourselves from our collective objectives.Damage is done regardless of the video or not but I do appreciate the courage to speak out to us fansYou're an amazing owner! Well done 💯He's been forgiven but it's up to supporter in Liverpool to welcome him or not. I always stand with Spion Kop and support Liverpool FC from far away as long as the club still respecting the entire family of the club and also the history. YNWANever forget what he wanted to do. He will do it again mark my wordsto be fair this is a class and genuine apology. he isn't reading off a teleprompter or just using empty words...like someone said, forgive him for the first and last time. no second chances.Worst thing fans can do is fall for there PR apologies. The fans need to continue riding that wave of momentum and push to get these owners out or face the same cycle. The fans have proven they can change anything with enough pressure. Bring in the 50+1 rule too!Thanks for appreciation the role of other teams especially the fans and coming clean. YNWAFair play to him. It's a rare billionaire that will take responsibility and apologise. The last ten years have been great; let's hope the next ten are too.Definitely reading a speech someone else has written for him he doesn't seem genuine. Because of him and his greed our club could be punished and that is absolutely unacceptable as the players and managers had no say in what happened with the ESL. I hope he gets whats coming to him and a lot lot more for doing this to us especially after the year we have just had. However, it is amazing to see how many fans from the different clubs had banded together to achieve a common goal against the greedy leaders who have no regard for how we feel. This may be forgiven but we won't forget what him and so many others have done to our clubsI forgive him, sincerity in his voice and helped us from bankruptcy into winning elusive Premier League and Champions League. We move on and aim for top 4 position.Fair play to him at least he has the balls to do this interview but it was so neededRespect to you Sir!Thank God he did not pursue further with ESL. And it takes courage to own up to your own mistake. This is good leadership and should be applauded. 👏We're not just LFC, like we've been branded, we're Liverpool Football Club. Never forget that.The reason football is so loved and attached to people worldwide is because it is for everyone. 
Anyone can compete with every possible opponents and even beat the top teams.
Feeling of attachment, togetherness make people happy, sad, thrilled along with their team performance and achievement. This makes football so beautiful that it becomes a part of life, family, culture and tradition.

Yanks should keep their concept of viewership and subscription money in USA or just leave.It takes a big man to apologise and it makes it easy for me to forgive!  All families have disputes we are no different "We are Liverpool this means more!non of the owners had the guts to apologize this man has massive respectI actually trust this,he is starting to understand what's important to usWell done. A genuine apology. Respect. Apology accepted. Now it is up to the public to forgive and move on. YNWAI think he is a good man and everybody deserves a second chance he did much more for the Club then the manu ownersRespect our captain HENDERSON ❤️🙏John W Henry is the man !Now here comes the liverpool boss.. with a genuin apology... No one did this but this guy just showed what we (fans/ liverpool family) means to this guy... 
I respect your apology and you really made us proud un doing this (making a you tube video to apologize) as i have never seen him that active in you tube.. 
You deserve our support after all you r liverpool family as well.. 
YMWA..🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼

P.S THANKS FOR THIS.. THIS MEANS A LOT .🙏🏼💕Respect the chairman for standing up. Apology not accepted, forgiven but not forgotten.I would take this apology because everyone deserves a second chance and at least afterward he didn't forget that it is all about the fans so if you don't forgive him that's your opinion but I think it's the wise thing to do.Thanks for coming upfront. As LFC fans we should recognise this. No other owner came on spoke out they only released statements.

They did make a mistake. Dont forget they won us the PL after 30 years.Not like other football owners... 
He said what is truth! 
We should forgive him!To those fans that forgive him. I respect you for that. To those that continues to flame him, go get a life. Do not pretend you are an angel and never makes mistakes in life. At least he got a pair to admit it. That deserves more respect than those haters.When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark...Almost three months later and I still ain’t forgiving him (unless he signs Mbappe)You are forgiven by me as a liverpool fan..everybody makes mistakesI accept your apology.  And please to you.  Grow your LFC into a more attractive team than ever before.  I am grateful for the past 10 years.  Thank you for your continued support.
You'll Never Walk AloneI understand and I forgive him
Every one isn't perfect  everyone do mistakes  I think he won't do any mistakes in future. I am happy that Liverpool isn't coming to an end
YNWA❤️❤️❤️mad respect for doing that and hearing our voices. let's move on from this now now all English clubs have pulled out of the super leagueIm  the Kop over 40 years and stick with the team through thick and thin. Thank you John Henry for your message. It has been tough for everyone this year. But we will weather out this storm together.I forgive him but he has to know this won't be forgotten.This apology is not because he listened, it's because he lost. We (fans) won, they (greedy owners) lost. I'll never forget what all the owners tried to do. They tried to destroy football, they should never be forgiven for that.It takes a man to admit he is sorryforgiven but not forget,
respectsThe only owner who actually apologised in front of a camera. He made a big mistake, but at least he was adult and humble enough to face the media. I respect him for that.You can’t stop me from loving my club ever! 🔴I didn't expect him to apologize, so fair play for himGood on him for having the guts to show his face and apologise, none of the other big 6 owners have yet.
But I feel the damage done to FSGs rep is irreparable. Time to sell up to owners that actually care about football and not just the money they can makeJohn W Henry we appreciate the courage to apologize to the fans and staff, it shows the passion you have for the club. Only the best do that! 🔴 YNWA!Thank you for hearing out fans, players and management. Let's move forward! YNWAEverybody makes mistakes is important to acknowledge learn from them and grow to move on. Thank you for having the courage to step in and apologize to everyone. YWNWA.one of the hardest 48 hours as a lfc suppoeter felt like the club was going away  thank you for the apology but we wont forgetWe’ve CONCERD ALL OF EUROPE WERE NEVER GONNA STOP COME ON LIVERPOOL big respect for leaving esl you’ll never walk aloneFair play Liverpool football ⚽️ club is a great family YNWAIt takes a real man with honour to apologise like that. I appreciate it. YNWAThat's why I love LFCIt takes a big person to admit mistakes and apologize.It’ll take more than an apology to come back from this. 
This wasn’t just a mistake made over a couple of days. It’s been months, maybe years in the making and all that time it’s been carried out in the shadows. The level of deceit is so great, how can we ever trust you again? 
This will never be forgotten.It’s hard to not think he is only apologizing because things didn’t workout the way he wanted them too.We accept his apologies big up to all our supportersI personally accept he made a terrible error of judgement and may have been led down this road by other owners, who knows?!
But at least he has been man enough to apologise to any people who he upset. That takes character and I for one think we all deserve a 2nd chance.At least he has the balls to apologize. But this isn't a simple case of "sign mbappe and we forgive you", that's the exact culture which led to this in the first place. You can't let the soul of football, and sport, be sold.At least he was the first and bold enough to face the fans... Respect....YNWAThis is my club, my pride and my team YNWA❤️He has stood up like a real leader and took responsibility. John Henry is good with me."We heard you. I heard you." Allow me to roll my eyes.I truly forgive him. And I hope we all can. Lets stay a solid family YNWA♥️They made mistakes in the past, they've made some good decisions, they apologised. I'm open to give them another chance. 

At least he had the guts to do that video. Needs to be respectedFOOTBALL IS NOTHING WITHOUT FAN.......appreciate that.....YNWA....support and believeLiverpool actually have a decent owner who can apologize. FairPlay to the fans and your club. Jurgen said he will try and fix it and that the owners were reasonable people, I respect the structure of this club.Fair play. He’s done what the others haven’t. Think we can all forget this if you sign Kylian and give Jurgen a contract extension 👍🏻Unlike typical nonpologies, he actually said the key words "I am sorry, I made a mistake. Its my fault." That is so uncommon, its unexpected to be sure. Normal nonpologies usually go like "I am sorry you felt like I let you down" or something like that.  100%!If you disregard Mercedes, this is actually a very competitive line upCongratulations to Lewis Hamilton for winning the 2020 Italian GP tomorrow!2019: drivers blocking each other during qualifying in Monza 

2020: drivers blocking each other during qualifying in Monza 

Lewis: interesting tactics2019: Leclerc on pole and won for Ferrari.
2020: Gasly is the only driver of an Italian team to be in Q3... and then won.

EDIT: HOLY SHIT. The madlad did it. He won.This time Lewis may overtake Leclerc





By lapping himThat save from Magnussen was actually quite impressive!The situation with Ferrari isn't even funny anymore, it's just sadIf Bottas ever gets pole you know the script for Sunday:

“It’s lights out and away we go”
“And a great start from Hamilton, a dreadful start for Bottas, he’s 3rd (4,5,6 etc) after the first couple of corners”

EDIT: TOLD YA!Banning engine modes seems to have hurt Red Bull more than Mercedes 😅Carlos was such a smooth operator, that no one noticed his 3rd place? I'm looking for lights out, and see mad Max charging. He must be angry for his place in qualifyingWhy isn't anyone mentioning Carlos's P3? So proud of Mclaren and carlos, legit the only good highlight this week apart from all the boring races, where only Mercedes have been winning and Red bull coming in 2nd or 3rd. Hopefully there's a change in the podium tomorrow!Tenho muito orgulho de ser fã de Lewis Hamilton...😄😄😃😃😁😁tomorrow’s race: 
everyone optimistic because monza has long straights.
Lights are out.
decent racing for 2/3 laps.
everyone starts getting split up
a huge gap forms between the top and midfield  teams.
mercedes are 50 seconds ahead of everyone. 
1.5 seconds separate valterri and Lewis throughout the whole race.
few overtakes here and there nothing too special.
chequered flag.
Lewis wins.That Q1 moment is how we want the actual racing to beRace begins : and it is lights out, Hamilton in front
Race ends : get in there lewis2021: Ferrari wins the F2 championshipBased on top gear's logic, this year's ferrari road cars will be amazing.Sainz 3, Perez 4, Verstappen 5?! We are in for an exciting raceCarlos is really showing sainz of improvementRed Bull: Party mode is banned, now we can fight!
Mercedes sets the fastest lap in the history of F1It's almost like every time Valterri just manages to give 120% and finally snatch pole from Hamilton with a sensational, seemingly impossible time to beat, Hamilton casually says "Oh so you think you've taken my pole from me? That's cute.."

/proceeds to breaking lap record

Valterri: Cries in Finnish.. 😢A corrida foi simplismente incrível...my God!!!That middle sector from Lewis was something else 🤯Those mercs are on tracks. I invite everyone to enjoy one of the best and almost perfect F1 car ever before the season is over.F1: Bans party mode.
Mercedes: “Call an ambulance..... But not for me.”Normal Quali: Qualifying
Monza '19: VSC deployed
Monza '20: green flag racingGet ready for another "It's lights out and away we Get in there Lewis!" How exciting!Legend in the making. We got to live this moment. Being a Fernando Alonso fan, never really liked ham, but this guy has gone from strength to strength. He looks completely unmatchable now.Wow Hamilton’s on pole! This is why I love F1. They never fail to surprise me3 things; No more words for Hamilton. Valtteri is so incredible. Shame on you if you still can't see Carlos Sainz for what he really is, knowing that Lando is no  joke behind the wheel.2019 qualifying: everyone waiting like a traffic jam
2020 qualifying: everyone racing in qualifyingOcon making progress in becoming the new GrosjeanWell done carlos. You deserve all the good results u get.F1: "bans party mode"

Ferrari: I guess we'll just have a Funeral then..Say it with me guys




When qualifying has better racing than the Grand PrixF1 : Bans party mode 
Mercedes: Unlucky for you , we party all the time.Lewis flippin' brilliant as usual, but I'm honestly really impress Bottas is hanging with him so well. He's starting to look a little more aggressive like he was in Williams. Hopefully he carries it through the raceThis is brilliant stuff to watch..... no party mode and still Mercedes are out there in the front and proving they have genuine pace. Don't feel bad Valtteri your are there and that close in a race is going to make it very interesting. Stay close and push at the end. 
Lewis Hamilton, yet another master class.  I am sure Valtteri isn't listening anymore, but I know that without him there Lewis could not be this good. As always keep it far and keep it clean. But never underestimate the race craft of the World Champion.

Fingers crossed the Mercedes engine is robust enough to cope with the mode used to get pole. 
Well done Sainz, Perez, Verstappen, Norris....  and  Ricciardo. Thats not a mid-field battle thats THE battle for third. 
I can see Verstappen  trying to push his way to third quickly and I hope that doesn't cost someone precious points.
Sainz and Perez should get a tow from the two Mercedes and hopefully that will get them in the right place for the first few turns.
Given half a chance Norris could be the one to make the first move.If u ignore the mercs, this quali was insanely good. And even the battle Bottas and Hamilton was nerve wreaking. Lovely qualifying.Amazing how Kimi still had a brillant time in the first sector despite the battle with OconIncredible performance Lewis amanzing, nice driving 👍F1: No more party mode in qualifying.
Mercedes: party all the time.Gasly casually starting from 10th and winning the raceWow!!!! Well done Carlos Sainz....... 
Everyone: Hamilton the "party mode" is switched off

Hamilton: hold my beer.....I think that was a smooth operation from Carlos... Thx for all the likes!!!Big thanks to F1 on the seemingly more improved camera angles! last week's race included!!Martin Brundle: „Ocon with the widest Renault in existence there“

*Petrov and Kubica have entered the chat*


*Fernando Alonso has left the chat*Must be extremely frustrating to be Bottas this year to try and figure out how to beat Lewis. 69 THOUSANDS of a second could literally be anything a tap of a button, a slip in grip, his weight, his reaction time. Like wow that’s toughGood to see the “Party Mode” ban worked out well. Mercedes look even stronger than before and it seems to have slowed there closest competition down.This Q session has been more enjoyable to watch than any F1 race in the past year or soI usually like the underdog.  But Lewis is a force of nature. KudosReally amazed to see a Ferrari driver perform after so many days( next year Carlos Sainz).What we need is a TV feed and commentary that ignore the Mercedes pair. If we had that, this season of F1 would be the best we've had in a long time. As it stands, sport is just not as interesting when you know who will win before it starts.That was superb racing. seeing Kimi fight with Renaults gives me hope for him.Magnussen kept that slide. That’s pretty impressive. He rallied that haasAfter a long time a qualifying session that's been really interesting.. 😁This was so exciting and unpredictable.. WOW! MERCEDES ONE TWO WOOHOOHamilton is a BEAST in that Merc! But I don't want to predict a win tomorrow just yet.The end of Q1 had more racing action than what we will get in the entire grand prix tomorrowMINARDI WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN ! CONGRATS !!!Im a Hamilton fan but I feel so happy for Gasley and a change of pace was well needed.Good job Sainz 👏🏿👏🏿🔥Its amazing how much the cars move around on the back straight.Depuis toutes les semaines et weekend je vis la Formule 1 plus d'émotionsFIA: Bans party mode
Hamilton: Losing power
Also Hamilton: New track recordI tried to go and see the pilots exiting the track after quali (I live half an hour away from Monza), got bored after waiting for an hour and went away. Still, it was quite interesting to hear the F2 cars roaring through the trees, a suggestive sound. Hope to be able to see the GP after the pandemic will end hopefully.Great job Valteri! Hope you have a run at first!!Hamilton 2013: "Vettel dominance could bore fans"
Hamilton 2020: .............. *snore*I cannot believe how incredible the Mercedes turnsOMG !! Mercedes on pole .. Never saw that coming.  Well it’s lights out and time to go to bed.Monza for Merc McLaren and Racing Point: TEMPLE OF SPEED
Monza for Ferrari: Temple of painHow can a car be better than anyone else in every circuit? Its amazingI can imagine Jenny Gow interviewing; "Valtteri, you were on pole for 5 seconds, how did it feel?"2020 and still waiting for Leclerc's first win in legal car.Paliza que le metió mercedes a Ferrari, demostrándole lo que es realmente mejorar de un año para otro.Red Bull: Lets ban party mode, so we get close to Mercedes power in quali. 
FIA: Fine, whatever
Mercedes: Remember, you asked for that, not me.*Tomorrow's race be like:*

It's light's out & away we go... Lewis Hamilton wins the Italian GP, Valtteri Bottas takes 2nd to complete another Mercedes 1-2 & _(insert driver name)_ comes home P3!

*edit:* jeez i never got so much likes before😅 tysm for that & Mercedes didn't get 1-2 this time hehe. congrats Pierre Gasly! 🎉McLaren on the second row ❤️🎉🍾,  it's been a long time 🤗I'm quite impressed by Bottas recently. Seems like he can rarely ever beat Hamilton but it's not often you see the 2nd driver keep up so well, i hope Mercedes keeps him. Also while the Mercedes dominance is quite frustrating to watch, it's cool to see how close the followers are to one another. Really seemed like under the right circumstances, any of the top10 teams couldve made 3rd.When i heard ricciardo got fastest first sector, i thought he would give mercedes a tough challenge but ended in p5. 
But again i wanted to say renault power unit has improved a lot.Glad to see Carlos in the fight! I wonder if he is wishing he stayed at Mclaren for 2021?I was laughing by happiness to see Carlos Sainz in P3F1: Mercedes, you can't use several engine modes any more. You have to choose one for the entire qualifying.
Mercedes: Ok, I'll use party mode then and manege the throttle.“Max verstappen goes third, no he doesn’t” ....f1 routine😂I saw Kimi get blocked and I knew the team radio would be exactly what I expected... I'm gonna miss Kimi...Riccardo going to mclaren looks like a good move for next year 👍🙂The scary part is on that fastest lap by lewis he backed off and played it safe in the last sector. He was nowhere near the best line through parabolica to carry the best speed through to the finish line. He knew he was like 0.3 secs up on valtteri on the lap and had enough room to breathe and still get pole. Dude is so good at managing a gap it's ridiculous.Kimi must’ve had balls of steel to have followed that Renault so close and not crash outFIA: No party mode.
Mercedes: Enabling Festival mode.Q1 more and better action than in every F1 race this seasonF1: No more party mode
Mercedes: Well there's gonna be a party... afterwards.. when we winMerc engine is so durable they’re going to use party mode for the entire race 😂😂I can see how McLaren have a point to prove including Carlos Sainz in 3rd... that just makes me wanna smile again.
Hamilton Reaction: I GOT 1:18!!Well played by Kevin, that might as well have been in the wall with that amount of speed.Just to let you know that Hamilton's Q1 time on mediums was faster than all the other teams in Q3 with soft tyres.
1:19.514 Hamilton Q1 (medium)
1:19.695 Sainz Q3 (soft)Why is this more like a race, less like a qualifying session?“Sebastian....bring the car back in one piece. Not bring back just one piece.” Poor Vettel 😢 Hang in there! 👍This is a legendary mid-field battleActually when you really think about it. that rare min race was actually beneficial for both the teams and drivers.  To get a gimps of the cars performance in race conditions against rival cars before the actual race.  Not simply a matter of qualifying times to be had ,but also to see if the car's tweeks have made any noticeable improvements in racing conditions.2019 Germany : Vettel started P20 and came home 2nd. 
2020 Monza : Vettel started P17 and literally came home (left F1 after the race).The correlation between the speed of the cars around any circuit and the enjoyment of the spectacle of F1 is surely to now be acknowledged as non-existent! 
F1 must love the likes of Brundle and Croft in their skill in delivering exciting commentary over boring race weekends!very impressive from charles to finish his lap and immediately get on the radio to kimi"Unfortunately it was Bottas' eye that blinked" - Martin BrundleRIP Seb I feel so bad for him, Ferrari’s holding him back so much...What else is left for Lewis to prove...! He's the GOAT...!Leclerc 2019 : What a mess
Vettel 2020 : What a mess
2021 : Yeah, I see where this is goingDid here how quick Lewis was up changing the gears, never the less he’s absolutely brilliant along with Mercedes 😃Good thing I don't have to watch the full race on Sunday. Congratulations to Hamilton on his victory in Monza!
I will simply watch highlights of the race tomorrow evening and save 2 hours of my time 👍McLaren best qualifing in years and can’t show more than the last couple seconds of the lapAnd now imagine a one 1, 2 for Seb and Kimi...Mercedes and McLaren have decided to keep party mode on all the time. I think some amazing engine blowouts could be on the cards todayF1: “Yeah this technical directive to abolish engine modes should hamper Mercedes in qualifying”
Mercedes: .8 seconds faster than anyone in qualifyingHamilton aprendeu a pilotar com Nelson Piquet (o Tri campeão)2019 Quali: Q3 chaos.
2020 Quali: The party starts *now!*Good job Sergio Perez 🇲🇽Let's see Carlos moving from 3rd in Quali to 17th next seasonHere after the absolute chaos and Gasly on P1!Lots of guy including me expect another HAM BOT VER grid, and then Carlos be like "Nobody expect the spanish inquisition"Hamilton just keeps dominating. Hats off to him man. 🙌Does this mean that quali will give a better taste of what the race will be like since the engines are in the same mode? If so im ready for that verstappen sainz battleHamilton could have gone even faster if he committed to parabolica in his fastest lap, that’s the scary thing. I think he likes to take joy in crushing Bottas’ hopes and dreams"What a race" 👌👌Hats of to Mercedes engineers, while everyone else is fighting for slipstream they just go out in clean air and still beat the next best by 8 tenths"to be in the same team with lewis to be honest, sometimes it's a pain in the ass because he's pretty quick. you know, he's tough to beat"

-valterri
(drive to survive s2)Another job well done Binotto running Ferrari right into the dirt !!Deep down Horner, Max and the rest know clearly Lewis is in another level.Hamilton's on pole, that was unexpected!heads up to mercedes making a fair fight between bottas and hamilton neither had slipstream and it was closeFIA : Bans party mode to tighten the field.
Mercedes : Are you sure about that.
*Rest of the grid* : Yessssss !!!!
Mercedes : Causally breaking track record multiple times in Monza without a row and qualifies 8 tenths clear.
*Rest of the grid* : Surprised Pikachu face.Give Raikkonen that Mercedes and he will do a lap in 1:17:100 . That guy is naturally so fast in spa and monza .More Q1 like this please, great drama, had to double check I was watching 'qualifying' highlights!Must give credit to Bottas, if it wasnt for him to have Hamilton as a teammate he could be the one that wins the championship. And he is the one with the fastest lap in history on this circuit. Great qualyIt will be very interesting seeing the Maxter starting P5, but i think he still be finishing in te podiumHonestly Q1 is probably gonna be more exiting than the whole raceCarlos, man the poor guy is making the most out of his last year with McLaren before not making it to Q3 next year.If you compare hamilton vs bottas in q3 you can see bottas gaining speed in corners and losing to hamilton on the straights... different downforce settings or does hamilton get more power?Grazie ragazzi,
Grazie mille,
Grande lavorro,
super car,
nice job guys!
this is what we talking about!!
P17!!what a drive by hamilton.....respect for bottas tooBottas new track record: Yes!! Finally
Then, Hamilton broke it: Hamilton, again?!!A moment of Silence for Kimi's Lap record in 2018Poor Seb. Hope things get better for him, he's a great guy and he deserves more.Thankful mercedes for having both of your drivers with no slipstream out qualifying 3rd place by over 7 tenths of a second, very cool!Those mercs don't even seem like the same machines as the other cars, they just seem so stable evrrywhereSeeing Vettel knocked out in Q1 hurts, just been so unfortunate after red bullEveryone says 2020 has been a terrible year, but Sainz is worried about 2021."Heineken" ???? Billboards? Monza? I long to see proper Italian icons like the Agip fire breathing lion in the back ground views. Monza🇮🇹 history is epic. Passion! ♥️ From U🇺🇸SA👍✌️It’s pretty clear to me at least, whatever the FIA and Ferrari situation was in pre season is the reason for this drop off. How do you go from winning races to back of the field unless you were doing something illegal. The FIA wouldn’t even let the other teams know what they found on the Ferrari cars but this drop off in pace makes it quite obvious. Sad to see but it is what it isEn tres segundos pasan los 20 autos es una locura jajajajajaja ta cañónIts good to see mclaren getting better good stuff mclaren.Can we not overlook the fact that Mercs is the only car in field which is able to reach 1:18 mark, and how everybody else still not able to beat Kimi's 2018 record?Great competition...

Almost 1 second difference from the first 2 to the third driver...


Long live MotoGP!!This would have been a great opportunity to trial the reverse grid sprint qualifying format.Race: It's lights out and away we go and LEWIS HAMILTON WINS THE 2020 ITALIAN GRAND PRIX! Oh and what a wonderful season it has been for Lewis!


Bono: Get in there Lewis!

Edit: I was wrong😆😂"It's always the blink of an eye, and it's always Bottas' eye that blinks"No one talking about Carlos, he is the most underated men I’ve seen in lot of years of F1Magnussen save on the gravel wow. 😳what i think is interesting is that when ferrari was on top, every 2 years, if not yearly some rule change was made to hamper their progress (for example: refueling. ferrari was mastering short, quick stints with low fuel -> bam no more low fuel) and now the rule changes help the dominant team, which has the most dominant period ever in f1.

its like they want f1 to dieSainz for podium!Mercedes makes it past corner one: 

Yep the race is overAs a Tifosi man I have cripling depresion ever since the start of 2020 and sadness since 2015 Hopes of anything good this race or next race are doneYou don’t have a Red Bull on the second row of the grid but you do have a Bullfighter!!! Il Matador!!!! Carlos Sainz!!!Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton for winning the 2020's WDC of two cars!!!!Mercedes-AMG Petronas, everyone - new track records on Monza, without party mode, without a tow. Absolutely ruthless.If ocon doesn’t get a penalty I’ll be surprisedLooking at the times from P3 down, this could be a really interesting race/season if you ignore the Mercedes.Im just happy for Sainz and PerezTomorrow: and it's lights out and get in there lewis
edit: aged like bad milk!My life is completed when i see the gap between hamilton and bottas is 69I'd like to see Hamilton's and Bottas' lap comparisonMercedes were so good they had to go out to the track first to give the others their tow, therefore allowing everyone else to catch up.Imagine you're driving the quickest F1 car ever that guarantees a championship, but your teammate is Hamilton 😔Wow! What a control from K-MagYou missed the part where Vettel threw out a tape measure from the cockpit after pitting. Ferrari is shambolic this season!Q1 was chaos!!!




I love it!!!I think what we're starting to see is that Bottas is indeed capable of pushing and taking the championship from Hamilton.

Just let them race and stop holding him back!FIA: Haha now we're removing the party mode and annoying Mercedes.

Mercedes: *Hold my fastest lap in history!*Hamilton’s about to smash every formula 1 record 🤣🤣🤣👌What can you say about Mercedes?! Just absolutely class! 
I’m getting very annoyed by this track in Qualifying I have to say it’s farcical! Last year and this year have been terrible honestly. Maybe F1 should ditch Monza now, and have the Italian Grand Prix at Mugello.Thank you Formula 1 for 6.38 mins of highlights during a World Wide Unprecedented once in a lifetime Deadly Pandemic/Recessions/Unemployment/Financial Disadvantage/ Lockdown 
as always consistently generous of you  !!!! Thanks also to Bernie hope you are enjoying your retirement :) I look forward to about the same for the Race Highlights 
# Kindness/Grace Period/Fans Support/Good Intention/Same with Spa, there was a part where poor Karun (last time was Anthony, i think) analyzing the onboards saying as you can see on the screen here, taking the apex bla bla bla... yet the video shows only the garage of the teams and not switching to the screen under discussion. 
Nobody knew what on earth Karun was talking about and Crofty stayed silent as if nothing happened.Lewis Hamilton is a perfectionist
And i love itOne minute of silence for those who thought party mode ban will bring Mercedes closer to others.

2 minutes of silence for Red bull fans 😂😂My heart broke as a fan of VettelWith Max starting p5 it should be interesting.Great drive CarlosFia: no engine modes
Sainz: hippity hoppity 3rd is now my propertyIt hurts to see Ferrari struggling in their own Grand prix.Sainz making peace with the fact that next year he will be at the back of the gridMy congratulations to Pierre gasly the Brilliant driver of a brilliant race(1) Banning party modes has achieved nothing!!! (2) Well done Sainz! Enjoy the Grand Prix this year mate because you won't be next year!!! (3) Well done Perez!!! Deserved of your talent more than anything else. All Spanish speaking second row too and without the great Alonso! (4) Don't worry Max. I am sure you uttered every expletive under the sun when you found out your starting position but you've got race craft to match the very best so you'll make up ground. (5) Well done Gasly!!! (6) Ahhhh Ocon you odd French ball! You're going to cause Fernando pain next year, I just know it! (7) Well done Kimi for beating a Ferrari and (8) I'll say it again even if my fingers are sick of typing it, Ferrari were right to sack Vettel!!! Enjoy the Mercedes victory every one. I wonder who will finish third? That is the question!Sad they didn't give Bottas a chance. He was clearly faster. He got only 0,069 from Ham with no slipsteam (worth 0,40-0,60 in Monza) being always the first out .**Ferrari out of Q1**

Williams: First time?you should make prismarine blocks and make "Queen Lizzie's Ocean Castle" and make a HUGE lilipad with the castle on iti love how when lizzie went into the nether there was a achievement and sausage was like: "be careful its dangerous in there" so sweet!!9:31 
OK SO WE JUST AREN’T GONNA TALK ABOUT LIZZIE’S SINGING? 
it sounded really good i-Lizzie: “But this time, I’m prepared”
Elder guardian: ima ruin this woman’s careerLizzie: Climbing up a ladder.

Joel: Hello Lizzie.

Lizzie: *screams quietly*I like the fact it clips to Joel's villagers slowly being corruptedMake a Prismarine Castle! The other Empires will be sure not to mess with you!Joel: "Hello Lizzie!"
Lizzie: *other worldly noises* "AuGhHhH"This is my first time coming across your channel, but you’ve made my night with this series. I’ve watched all 4 and now I’m waiting for the 5th one. Also, anyone reading this, I hope you have a fantastic rest of your day/night!“i’m just here to harvest some souls” 









sounds peaceful to meLizzie, now that you’ve conquered the sea temple you can make a fully powered conduit!!!Use  the prismerine to upgrade your conduit. When it's a fully powered conduit, it will damage other hostile mobs. This could be a great way to protect your empire.Omg this is perfect, of course Liz would be afraid of the nether-shes literally the ocean queen. And in the nether there’s no water, and you can’t even place water down! Btw, amazing video. Once again!😩❤️You could use prismarine, sea lanterns and quartz to create an underwater city, sort of like Atlantis.I don't remember who really first posted on using tnt to quick hit the temples but he was a genius, it saves so many headaches Edit: if you didn't know or if no one has said the trick with your temple farm is to turn the particles to the lowest setting to not cause lag, those farms are lag monsters even on top machines when they are a full buildNo one:
Lizzie: Finds the end portal and nether fortress, casually.The way she said "pathetic" was hilarious, it sounded like she was some sort of wizard superior and she was disappointed in your magic skills lol (atleast that's how I picture it)Can we just appriceite how Lizzie has started to post more often:)Lizzie Hello! I’ve been watching your content since I was 7 and I’m 15 now(so going on 9 years soon) You’re a great inspiration and have gotten me through a lot of tough times. I’m so happy that you’re one of the few Youtubers I can sit and watch for hours on end! Have amazing luck with this series and any other work you do! Enjoy your day!
EDIT: Thank you for the likes everyone! 16 now and in a few months it’ll be 9 years Ive watched Lizzy!Dear Lizzie, 
I love your videos! You and some other Minecraft youtubers that you played with in Base Invaders appeared in my Scratch programming class, it made me so happy to see you!
You are my favorite Minecraft youtuber!This series has Lizzie posting 4 times a month! She must be enjoying this series :)Lizzies singing is actually good I’d like to request more singing in vids 😂Can’t wait to see the new episodes! also, Suggestion!!  You should get a island for flowers for some dyes! :)i really enjoy this kind of minecraft stuff with cute mods,crafting, building and the shaders💕Lizzie just vibin while trying to get her stuff back is honestly iconicI like how everyone has literal castles and Lizzy has
✨  *LiLyPaD* ✨Anybody else rewatching the episodes because they are so fun to watch?You should definitely use the prismarine for either your castle, a throne, statue, or an ancient/enchanted sea garden!Make an underwater zoo surrounded by glass and call it a “landquarium”
Oh dang she actually did itIts great to go and watch lizzie back. One of my faves when i was young and apparently thats the case stillHaven't watched this yet but I just wanted to say this series is the first of your videos I've seen and I'm loving it! You are so fun to watch. (Hope that doesn't sound too creepy X'D)That one moment when your favorite YouTuber loses all her stuff in Minecraft, and you feel their pain so hard you want to cry. (And yes, Lizzie is my favorite YouTuber)I really love how lizzie just dramatically singing while go to the temple"Ocean's greetings, count Fwhip."
"Nice to see you—"
I loved that so muchLizzie has a Disney villain voice and Diseny princess vibes, and I love itLizzie is so lucky in this series. She really does have a lucky pickaxeStreaming more would not be a bad idea, if you have the time < 3Lizzie should definitely make an underwater village under her Lilly pads.Lizzy being the fortune person we all needEven though you have a shop for prismarine, you should make a miniature sea temple out of it for your royal axolotl guards to live in. Maybe tame some cats too?You should build a peismarine/fairy garden themed lily pad enclosed with glass for your axolotls :DI love how lizzie makes something that look so boring look so fun and funnyI'm obsessed with this series 🤩😅This is the only series from Lizzie that I watch in the correct order 🤩Lizzie: There is so much prismarine in here that I don't even know what to do with it.

Also Lizzie: *makes a prizmarine shine topped with a sea lantern as a token of her success*Guardian: kills lizzie
Lizzie: vibes, dramatic monologue, sings and kills sir strawberryokay but the dramatic monologue was actually everythingI love these episodes 👌🏻I think my favorite part is when Joel scared Lizzie. The small noise of the scare was amazingLizzie: *making her portal all cute and pretty* 
Also Lizzie: “now, I’ve made a portal to hell.”I love how the Guardian farm is the same exact video the Joel used for his 100 days videoI finished watching all of your episodes,But I was hungry for different scenes. So I have saved all of your friends playlists, And I plan on watching 1 of each at least once a day. I can't wait to see the behind the scenes of your cake law.Me: Worried about Lizzie's armor
Lizzie: "Sir strawberry is DEAD!"You should definitely make a primarine castle like the other comments have been saying!! You could also sell prismarine to the other people in the server!! :)“Please! Spare meeee. I am just coming to harvest some souls!” That got me good 🤣🤣Build a bigger conduit and make an underwater Kingdom which the underwater sea creatures can be the citizens of like a turtles, squids, axolotls or just plain fish. Also could like make a nautilus shrine or temple you could put it under water and it could be like the God/Goddess of the sea for Minecraft because you use nautilus shells to make a conduit. Also maybe you should try to connect your lily pads to the bottom of the sea cuz you know lily pads grow from the bottom of the sea (I think).Lizzie finds a stronghold without even trying
And now she finds a Nether fortress WITHOUT EVEN TRYING! 😂Why is no one talking about how amazing Lizzie's singing is?  Lizzie I love your videos xxMake a castle with the prismarine!! It will surely intimate other empires. Also your empire is cute!Lizzies singing voice is beautifulI can’t stop watching these videos they are so entertaining! I can’t stop binge watching them!!!!!!!!!I saw the "riches" part and thought: *WOOHOO*
And then saw the "ruin" and though: *Oh no...*I really like mimicking your videos with my new Invisi-Line aligners in. It's really fun to do!‘Please,I come in peace,I just want to harvest some souls!’ is something I never thought I’d hear 💀Idk if this was suggested but you should build cute bridges or like a boat shop for visitors!cant wait for the next episode <3 just came to rewatch from anthony padillas interview vid with u in it !“Look here he is”
“Alive and full of life”
I’m dying with laughterSo, she found a geode attached to a stronghold, with a Nether portal that leads directly to a fortress.  Her fishing rod isn't the only thing with Luck of the Sea...For the prismarine: I think you should enhance your conduit to make it more powerful, and build a castle with itInstead of having a normal house you should make a castle underwater close to your house so you don’t get lost like last time :))Lizzie seeing protection 1 on her chestplate: "Pathetic"
Me: She is really like a ruthless queen now.Firstly you need to remember your conduit, now that you have enough supplies to upgrade it!
You should build yourself a proper sea themed palace! The queen of the oceans can’t sleep out in the open forever!There's gotta be a mod out there that anything with a name tag respawns like players do when they die.Make a Prismarine Castle and a whole Village :DWhen Lizzie used a shovel to dig up the nether rack I laughed lol 

Timestamp: 7:11her singing is really good. but i think you should trade it with the other Empires so you can get rare things.Sir Strawberry: **dies**
Lizzie: That didn't even happen that was just a hallucination.she's so lucky to have spawned near the fortress 😲Fun Fact - She will post the Empire Smp videos only on Saturdays 😃Tip : when going to the nether, bring some gold and wear some gold pants to not anger the piglins, right click the gold while looking at the piglins to trade, just like trading with villagers.I love this series 👑👍🏻🥰🥰I feel like I can tell Lizzie is enjoying this series more since she’s uploading more frequently compared to x life :)

(she’s said before that she doesn’t wanna force herself to upload and it should be something she’s genuinely enjoying and motivated to upload abt)You should make an underwater ocean castle with the prismarine and give your “guards” a room with stairs that lead underwater for there tank :)i have been watching lizzie for 4 years and she is still going strong!!!Instead of having a burrow as your house, you can use the prismarine to make a castle!! It will surely intimidate other empires!Lizzie, just minding her own business: Someone is trying to kill me!
Joel: Hello Lizzie!You can upgrade your conduit area!Suggestion: Make a remastered version of a Sea temple with the prismarine and sell the leftovers!"Here he is, alive and full of live!" - Lizzie 2021I think lizzie should build her own lush cave or a bigger lily pad island for her growing axolotl army i love this series so muchLizzie:"How can I get in the nether with just iron armour"
Other YouTuber:"Who cares about armour let's go in the nether right now!!!!!"You should make a prismarine castle and get a collection of underwater pets and put them in the castle! :)So were not going to talk about how pretty her new shaders pack is ?!your glistening diamond armpit really matches your ocean theme 😊Lizzies inner British really comes out when she is in panic modeYou should finish your conduit with all that prismarine!Lizzie: "but now I'm prepared"
Elder Guardian: *boo*
also Lizzie: " *AaH* "Joel is obsessed with himself and I’m pretty sure we can all agree with thatYou should sell the premise of the primaries a lot of what they're called to the people for like one time and one gold whatever you needyou can make sea lanterns with the prismarine shards you have! : ]
*edit* TYSM FOR THE LIKESSS!I think you should make glowing roots for your lily pads out of lanternsThat thing you made to bring the guardians to the nether is so creative!!Create an Drowned Farm so you can farm Copper, XP, Trident and Nautilus Shell(To trade to Pix) so you can use it for tradinglizzie: **builds empire in the ocean**

“i’m getting a little bit land sick” 😂Lizzie should make a house underwater made out of glass. I think it would be really cool and you could see all the fish in the water. Its also pretty safe and hidden. She could expand it loads and it could be amazing!THESE SERIES SO COOL!! I liv your videos <3“I can’t find any nether wart.” 
Literally in a forest where blocks of the stuff grows on treees.i really love this vid i cant stop watching it ;DLizzie: being mellow dramatic while someone’s trying to murder her

Also Lizzie: looking to the side with blaze rods in her hand dramatically introducing themYou should make a hole for a mine like a magical cave 😊Lizzie I took inspiration from your lily pads and built a lily pad wedding venue in Minecraft for my two friends and they're getting married this weekend. I'm the maid of honour and will probably be performing the ceremony. I don't know why I felt the need to share this but I did, so here it is.Maybe with the prismarine, you could create a castle that's half in the ocean and half above water with a lilypad that surrounds the castle. Then with that large lilypad, you can create homes for your many servants that'll be catering to your every whim.Love the seriesSir strawberry would have been a great asset to the graveyard but he didn't die (definitely not)A nameee
beryl 
The name Beryl means ‘sea-green jewel’ or ‘a crystal of yellow or green colour’. This name is of Greek originme: *brightens my screen when she was in nether and leaves it on*
LD: *goes to village*
also me: "fig my eyesssssss"make an ocean castle with the prismarine, ps can you get a cat called cuddlesHi Lizzie, can u maybe make floating jellyfish in the sky? I think it would look pretty cute!Lizzie:I'm gonna be rich 

Also lizzie:jumps of the scaffolding"WheEeeE"
LolThx for posting my daughter has the hive and you really help me and my daughter I’m so thankfulLizzie really just goes around accidentally finding strongholds and nether fortresses huhLizzie: "I AM THE OCEAN QUEEN"

also Lizzie: *slaughters guardians*Lizzie: But this time, I'm prepared!
Guardian: *Slowly floats down from somewhere*
Lizzie: AAH!!9:31 is no one going to talk about her voice!? It's so good 😥✨✨Lizzie: *singing like an angel*
Also Lizzie: *says where am I like nothing happened”I love how Lizzie says guardian✨✨"Ocean Greetings"
"Nice to SEA you"

guys the ocean empire is quakingMake a peismarine lily pad to keep your subjects on <3I think you should either make a castle or you could make an establishment for maybe holding your valuables or holding your axolotl army. 

Also, if you get another axolotl, could you name it "Bubbles"?

Thank You so so Much!!!In the star you regretted to say ocean biome but now your empire is looking amazingYou should make a island where you make an “on land” sea temple and use it as your home or a place for your Royale guards!Is no one talking about how good Lizzie is at singinghey lizzie, is the new episode coming out soon, I'm so excited :)10:25 this is the most relieving moment in all of historyI swear you could be a Synchronous in an anime or a game..your voice makes me feel calm❤️Lizzie: except this time, I’m prepared
*a second later*
“AA-“Let’s enjoy the fact that lizzy has just the best empire😌🤩You should make a store/co-op like thing to sell your goods :)Lizzie: “Please, I come in peace, I am just here to harvest souls.” 

(A little while later)

The voices of the angry souls who want to stay in the netherMy sister told me about you. You're the best youtuber ever. literally binging everything rn :DI love how she said she is getting land sick but even though her lily pads are made with grass 👁👄👁
🤣😂lizzie panicking about her stuff is my reaction when I accidentally spend my  savings on food.Why is no one talking ab how good Lizzy is at singingInstead of having a burrow as your house, you can use the prismarine to make a castle!! It will surely intimidate other empires! copy and  paste it so she can see it and do it!
stared by Eloise MikkonenI love this seriesLando is straight killing it this year. The man has something to prove and is making people listenIf there was a reverse order championship, Mazepin would be world champion by the summer break.Are we gonna ignore the fact that Mazepin lapped Raikkonen 65 times today?*Engineer:* Do you want to drive fast or preserve the tyres?
*Perez:* Yes.Legends says checo is still waiting for the pitstopThis years title is going to be decided by who Mazespin blocks more. Is it Lewis, is it Max? Its a mystery.Nobody Talks about Micks great race, that he overtake Latifi and was one Minute ahead of MazepinSuch a beautiful circuit. The way it's designed, it makes the fights look faster and more dynamic. Loved the raceHamilton's move on Bottas in lap 20 was amazing to see as it happened.  A great race.Legend says that Mazepin is still on track finishing his race.Perez led more laps in this race than Gasly and Albon ever did with Red Bull.That move Lewis made on Valtteri was epic, definitely going to be in his highlight reels when he retires.5:38 impressive camera shot!!Carlos experiencing the brilliance of Ferrari strategy.You gotta love how Mazepin is completely dominating the comment section and the highlight reel.Alonso... Wow !
P8 being at 6s from Ocon and gained 5 secondes in 5 or 6 laps... 🤩Alonso is still in shape. Improve the car and he will still surprise many. The driver of the day for meMax isn’t fighting lewis this season, track limits are his main rival.i freakin love this track...seeing cars come over a hill at 170 mph is pretty coolI'm so happy for Lando's start of the season. He's pretty consistent finishing inside the top 5 in every race atm. 💪🔥That 5 second penalty was just detrimental to Mazepin’s 1:08 gap to the closest driverMazepin ignored 5 blue flags and then when Perez was trying to lap him, he blocked him. I think this proves how much he deserves to be in F1As much as I like to see Hamilton not win, he really is amazing. I just like to see the underdog winThis track looks quite fun with the hills into turns!Lewis świetna praca.SUPER.I'm happy both Haas drivers were able to get through all of the race. They are slowly but surely improving. I believe in them xLove that there's so much competition in the midfield now. And I love that Perez has a car under him that can really show what he can do.Can we appreciate Kimi being so chilled out that he literaly fell asleep while driving 200mph.Boa escolha do circuito de Portimão que lembra a antiga e ótima F1That move by Hamilton on Bottas is on another level.Williams in Imola: I'm almost passing a Mercedes
Williams in Portugal: passed by a HaasMax’s aggressiveness and natural ability combined with his now seasoned experience makes for a future champion.Hamilton is SO fast... it’s unrealI am impressed with the speed and agility of these cars at the end of the main straight ... that is insane, those guys have to be from another planet to control the cars.No mention of Kimi's rookie error, and on his teammate mind you. If that were Mazepin, the comment section would have melted.Mazepin is the best thing that ever happened to Latifi.That was an utter driving masterclass from the 7 time champ. He's only getting started!!Get in there, Lewis! Congrats for the 8th title!🥳🥳🥳🥳👑👑👑👑I love this circuit😍The blue Renaults looked beautiful and fast today. Lots of exciting midfield action again like last year.Another hit for the Brackley Boys! Congratulations again for the entire Team, mainly Sir Lewis, of course!excellent race yu can see where the talents is, Max and Lando always shinePerez is starting to show his strengths this season. Used those tires to the rim.It's pretty pleasant finally see Pérez fighting for the first places.Mclaren team is amazing Lando fantastic race, Daniel from P16 to P9 👏🏼👏🏼Mazepin is making latifi look like a world championThe circuit is great for competition; chasing each other and that is what makes racing interesting.I guess no one will mind having longer highlights (say 10 minutes) as there are so many cool things to watch again, especially for this new season that promises to be more dynamic.Fantastic track. I missed it last year but not today. I hope it keeps in the calendar for long.What race LH is such an amazing driver... Kudos to VB MV tooHamilton: My tires are gone 
*fastest lap*
Also Hamilton: My tires are fine
*pits*When lewis overtook verstappen that was the shear power of the merc but when he overtook bottas even lewis haters have to agree lewis is one heck of a racer.Wow, I think Alonso has been the driver of the day, cuz he was like 15th position, but he did very well at the moment of change position to 9th, 8th, nice work Alonso.Another stellar drive by Nikita Mazepin. Never before have I seen such driving!When mazepin got 5 second penalty the arabic commentators said even if fia add a day on his time it won't make any difference 😂😂😂Another win by Lewis. Great drive as usual.Haas: With Roman and Kevin gone we can improve
Mazspin:Hold my beerI don't see any FIA + LH comments. People don't wanna give the man his roses with that massive GAP!!! Also tipping my hat to Lando, keeping his head down and putting in that work!!I'm so happy to see Perez in a genuinely competitive car.Leclerc and lando both have super potential. Hope the best for themWho's gonna be quicker: 
Lewis clinching the championship or Mazespin losing his super licenseAbsolutely love Crofty and Brundle's commentary! Gold standard stuff!!!Lewis delivers another masterclass. Driver of the day.. Lewis Hamilton.Wonderful drive Max!!!!!!What a battle!!! 
Lando was doing a great jobWhen Mazepin is one lap behind his rookie teammateMax is the next dominator, hands down. He is already the fastest in rain.2020: Hamilton overtakes Bottas at Turn 1 during lap 20
2021: Hamilton overtakes Bottas at Turn 1 during lap 20Nobody is talking about how crazy fast the cars look at this track... AS THEY SHOULD.  Portimao top 5 race tracks.Its great to see hamilton help bottas straight off the start by fending off Vertsapen in the slipstream to then bottas trying to make Hamilton loose his placement after saftey car!! Great Teamwork there I think!!its so nice seeing alonso driving againI absolutely love how mazepin has must become a complete meme at this pointGOAT was sublime in this race. Passing both rivals on track.Lewis proved what an amazing racer he is; that overtake on Bottas was something elseMazepin ignoring the blue flag and only got 5 seconds when he's a minute behind. I was rooting hard for Checo...Ocon was great today, hoped he finished in the top 5can we appreciate Perez's 55 lap stint on mediums?It was awesome to see Schumacher and Latifi racing their tractors3:30 when the DRS wing slams shut, Lewis' car squats down much more than Valteri's 😲Who is excited to see Alonso's performance in Spanish grand prix. We want El Matador back !!!!Nikita Latifi: money could take us only this farWhat a showing by alpine...out of nowhere! Also great comeback by ricciardo thereLando Norris - Currently 3rd in the Drivers Championship - Absolutely awesome.Starting to believe Lewis' "my tires are gone" episodes are code for "I'm about to torch the field."1:36 highlight of the day: Mazepin is having the fastest lap on the fieldHamilton overtook Bottas and Verstappen on the track !
He didn't even need the help of a pit stop !
He is a true world champion  !1:35 Mazepins highlight of the dayAnyone who can't accept Lewis is the best of his generation are simply running out of reasons why not. That was yet another Sublime drive and win.Well done Daniel Ricciardo. You had a very bad qualy  you did an amazing job to go from 16 to 9.. 3rd race n so little time in car unlike Lando n u still scored points in every one of the races for the team.. glad to see that sky channel has at least shown some parts of you. 👏👏We did not see the intelligence and brilliancy of Mazepin not letting drivers through under blue flag while he is last by one minute to second to last only to add a 5 second penalty…. Such talentHad hopes for Lando to be on the podium but p5 is nice tooMan lando sitting at 3rd in driver's championship giving me chillsAnother masterpiece from Lewis. He has the X-factor of the winners. He deliversI think the only person that is happy Mazepin has entered F1 is Lance Stroll, who is now no longer the most disliked driver in F1.Ocon and Alonso did a fantastic job! 👏Portimao is such rollercoaster trackLewis makes it look easy but as we saw just how hard it was for Bottas to maintain his leadAnother great race from Lewis Hamilton.im surprise of alpine performance. and lando really do shiningAlpine showing great signs of improvement. The race gets instantly better when Fernando Alonso drives the way that he did today.Excelente Lewis Hamilton the best the world força Petronaswhat an absolutely amazing race Daniel had today gained 7 places and nobody talking about that" Hamilton wins in Portugal!

Two from two in the Algarve for the reigning world champion, and he had to do it the hard way, dropping to third in the opening few laps before making his way back past Verstappen and Bottas on track. He delivers, again. "So happy for the young guns - Norris, Gasly, Lecrec... They're doing very well for their cars..Hamilton is a beast. Two great overtakes on Max and BottasWhen you realized Mazepin’s gap between Latifi is larger than the gap between the 1st and 7th placeHamilton  o Melhor !MEGA LEWIS , BRILLIANT MAX, EXCELLENT FIGHT BETWEEN THEM!That was a great race!Mazepin is going to create history ...for every race this season something will happen to that rookieWonderful race from Alonso from P13 to P8 with a great strategy from Alpine. He's still got it!!MAZ deserves the best driver of the day, he did not spin and did not damage his car!!!!

P20 to P19, well done dude!Portugal track is 🔥 🇵🇹Let's appreciate how mazepin is validating strollLewis Hamilton proves again he's the best to do it. EverPretty exciting track for racing for onceHeineken: "Don't drink and Drive"
Kimi after lap 1 "Bwoah! You were right"Lewis my goat 🙏🏿✊🏿Bottas lead an interesting restart. Hamilton was totally caught out by his own brilliance. Sadly this highlight missed highlighting that.Verstappen: "it didn't feel weird or wrong or as if I was outside track limits"

Also Verstappen: *OFF ROAD TIME*Perez almost finished the race with one set of tyres was funny to watch.🤣Lando Norris at 1 lap: "It's over Esteban, I have a high ground!"Imagine Latifi driving as fast as he speaks. 10 times World Champion incomingNorris looking like an early contender for driver of the season. He's really coming of age now.Giovanazzi i always thought was not F1 quality but tbh hes really improved a lot, outperforming kimi regularly nowThe last 2 races b4 today..i mentioned Alonso..in the top 5..now ..hes starting to show his rusty talent..n im bot surprise if he is in the Top 5..in his home country next few days..becoz..im been folllowing him since his Minardi time..a real fighter..hes mt driver of the day(DOTD)..KL,MsiaBottas: amazing when no one else is on the trackso every track not designed bei tilke is 🔥🔥, what a lovely layout reallyMazepin almost crashing with Perez getting lapped:  
Netflix: Mazepin Perez intense battle for driver title.I bet Lewis is excited to finally have a challengeGostei das legendas sempre quis saber oque ele fala no começo 😅😅You gotta appreciate what Bottas does for Mercedes, he still can fight it out in the front and be reliable and dependable to get the 2nd or 3rd spot if not the 1st spotIt was cool seeing the American owned team of Haas passing the American owned team of WilliamCrofty sounds like he's done saying "lewis hamilton wins the..." 😂😂😂Fernando Alonso showing he’s not too old yet 🤣. The mans still got it.Hamilton is fire 🔥 its amazing watching him perform and my hat off too the rest of the driversLando Norris is an underdog 🔥Slow-seb getting another prestigious 13th place 😂 Wonderful!Never mind driver of the day. That helicopter pilot was epic.👌🏼🚁Such a shame for Carlos, lost out massively due to the strategy.What do we think about Lando's McLaren fighting at the top? Going almost poll position at the previous race. I've heard very little about this. Maybe overshadowed by Red Bull contesting Mercedes.I'm glad Mazepin is so popular on the internet, he's already made his dreams come trueAlonso overtaking a Mclaren and a Ferrari? Not bad :)Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton 🇬🇧 for winning the Portuguese Grand Prix 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏.Bruh imagine how mazepin is gonna do in Monaco! Can’t wait lolas expected in lap 20 3:32, Bottas give his position to Hamilton once again for this whole 5 years he partnered with LewisNice to see the Alpines 7th and 8th after struggling the first two roundsThis is serious comeback by Redbull this season..Max Verstapen is not leaving an inch for Mercedes. Taking over Bottas was fabulous move. But taking over Bottas by Hamilton was more fabulous.Mazepin wasn’t mazespin today, we gotta be proud and only 59 seconds behind Schumacher wonderful1:33 Mazepin gets fastest lap of the raceAs much as I hate saying it, however, Hamilton put on an absolute clinic.pure skill ... hamilton is dopeCongratulations to Mr. Lewis Hamilton. Another great race. You are the greatest. Please keep winning. All the best. 💯👌👏🙏🙏🙏🙏💜🤎💛🧡🤞🤞🤞🤞Congratulations Sir Lewis hamilton.... What a drive 💪Absolutely EPIC!alpine did a solid job in the race !!Vamos checo vas muy bien 👍👏💪Plot Twist: Hamilton Holds Back on the first 3 races so he can achieve the Magic NumberI wish this circuit would stay. so much funlando has really stepped up his game this season!Nessa corrida o sainz vacilo na estratégia e terminou em 11loves to seeing alonso in the points againThe one and only ever fastest lap in race for Mazzepin (right after the race being restart)It was awesome finally seeing Fernando put out his legendary racing pace when fitted on the hards.La mejor parte fue cuando terminó. Al principio todo era entretenido y lucha hasta que llegó el botoncito "Tactics" A la carrera le sobraron 45 vueltas.Lando Norris is taking it to the next level this year.I miss the days where the track limits were the grass or the gravel.  The concrete walls in the worst case ...Lewis hamilton is unrealI’m amazed that Danny Ric managed to finish 9th despite how bad during the qualifying went for him.Great race!Lando is straight killing it this year. The man has something to prove and is making people listen absolutelyThat move Lewis made on Valtteri was epic, definitely going to be in his highlight reels when he retires.What race LH is such an amazing driver... Kudos to VB MV tooWhat race LH is such an amazing driver... Kudos to VB MV tooI love that the sand and gravel are basically legos and small balls respectively.0:25 the sand stuck on the shovel be like: *violently shakes and disappears when touches 1 grain of sand*more satisfying then real sandyou know this dude is gonna make a mod with all these realistic videosThere’s always got to be that one grain of sand that doesn’t cooperate and instead shakes violentlyMost realistic part was when a spec of sand got stuck in the shovel.Imagine mining amd then gravel falls on you like this, your computer would become tntIf only sand existed IRLNow I can replicate that lucius feeling of sand in minecraft AND destroy my pc while I do it!More like "Realistic Lego Sand"the sand is so realistic that it gets stuck in the shovel and suddenly disappearsAnyone else thinks the gravel looks like it tastes good or am I weirdLet’s get mindcraft on #1 trendingThis is actually really satisfyingThe intro reminds me of Minecraft vs Real life, love those days 😢Anyone else wish this was real so that you can build a mini city and be Godzilla??Why is this so satisfying"woah, this is gonna be so realistic! cant wait to see the sa- *_l e g o   s a n d"_*

its still realistic thoughFuture of Minecraft be likeThings was just Normal Minecraft with shaders until the sand turn into small boxesThis is super satisfying please moreJust came from Quasar@ the sand stuck on the shovel be like: violently shakes and disappears when touches 1 grain of sandI guess you need water to carry sand lolThe music for the intro is so nostalgicthe more relistic the more better than my eye sighti love how he tried to make it like "Minecraft Vs Real Life" like ItsJerryAndHarrynot bad keep practicing 👍*So realistic!*The lighting and the water graphics thoEs muy sactifactorio😍😍how did the sand and gravel chang into some tiny blocks...🤔 but itz ok the animation was good👍Nice now I can play with sand while hearing my PC screamingI thought I was in my garden for second 
I was like 
‘What? It literally 3 in the morning how the hell is it sunny outside?’Can u make a video where u put all the irl things together?thats more satisfying then real sand!If there should be a new gaming possibility, that would revolutionise all other gaming platforms, where we can go total VR around the world, without moving our bodys in reallife, i will play minecraft first. :D
An absolute full dive functionminecraft 2 looks pretty dopeparents when minecraft looks like this: now it looks realistic you can play it now
me: _misses old mc and kinda likes this new one_Makes you wonder what stabbing a mob would like likeHow many RTX 3090's did you have to get to do this?Somebody did a way more realistic version.That grass tho 🥰☺️Why this is so satisfyingIf the whole game would be like the animation then it will be difficult to beat it😅😅😅😅This made me fall apart.Satisfying 😌The gravel destroy first before Shovel hitThe gravel reminded me of snake skin for some reason-One day there will be realistic STEVE too!oh that music gives nostalgiaTeardown  be like....RTX Players: Nice, tomorrow I'll also try this RTX
Noobs: Oh come on, It's just nice graphics, but squares are still thereWow even the grass and water is realistic 
Gravel near the water: :((GOD loves y'all and have a Blessed day ✝️⛪🙏🙏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏾🙏🏽🙏🏿👼🏿👼🏾👼🏽👼🏼👼🏻👼😇🥰One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates,🎈0:31 Animation? pff thats like a VR game!!!

Nice videos!*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know:
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”But it is too realistic. Nice I like it 👍👍💕💕To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message 

Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ? 

the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all
Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved 

Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity 

 God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins 

God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved 

the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins 

receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today 

John 3 
For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. 

This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned

. But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].””
‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭

For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.”
‭‭Romans 6.23

2 Peter3

 9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sinsAnyone noticed the shovel has eyes On The handle or whatever you call it-


Oh wait its not eyes BUT IDK WHY IT LOOKS LIKE EYES TO MEMoment of silence of who thought this was a animation 

It was vrAlternative title 'too realistic shovel'Imagine a mountainNo joke this is like the real Minecraft ad vs the Voodoo Minecraft rip-off adAhhh too realistic that the sand GLITCHED into shovel lol 0:33that's also a too realistic shovelWow this totally looks like minecraftHow to break your PC with Mr.Askik!0:34

I cant find anything lol. You did too well.NiceWhy is this so satisfying to watch

Let's see how long it takes for @SALEMA to come at me with that spam bullcrap againThe camera movement is kinda linear, it doesn't have arc movement.Imagine if it was a mod...
Imagine my pc when i install the mod....

Vaccines aren't miracles. They are the products of research, curiosity, and the hard work of scientists. 
Follow me on Instagram and Twitter and let me know what you thought of this video! @DrJoeHanson @okaytobesmartSuch a fantastic video, thank you! I get really emotional thinking about how much we are capable of solving huge problems if we really put our minds to it. Very grateful to all the scientists, researchers, health workers, and so many more people, who have put in such a tremendous amount of hard work into developing and distributing vaccines in record time.Lots of love and respect to the science community. The media focuses a lot on crappy influencers, royals, actors and actresses , sports people but they forget about the people working anonymously to save and protect lives.Dude, amazing explanation video. I really wish they would show more of that on TV instead of all those depressing news about covid and political debates about every single decision.Can we please share this with the broader public? This video was so well designed and easy to digest. It answers so many questions.Gosh that PhD student really hit the jackpot of PhDsExtremely well presented! Thank you so much for all you guys and girls do!I wish Joe puts more subtitles in different languages...so that I can show this to my Japanese girl friend. THIS IS SO EDUCATIONAL AND MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD SHOULD WATCH!!Thank you for constantly reminding us how beautiful and important science is. Your last statement gave me goosebumps. Salute to all scientists. You are all heroes.Thank you for sharing the knowledge. Your narration states that the researchers in the lab had a head start because they were familiar with other coronaviruses of the past. 
My question would be- can they trace how and/or where sars cov2 was born/created? There are so many theories, it would be great to finally learn where it came from, factually (and not from a tv news piece). Thanks.Hi Joe, 

This video is awesome. And necessary! 

Have you thought in making them also in other languages? Like Spanish for example. There is a lot of fake news in Spanish and we need more high level science communication like yours.Note what he said at the beginning and the end: we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch!Very enjoyable to watch, also learned something new. But it's a shame to leave out completely the Mcllelan's lab's former postdoc, Nianshuang Wang, who discovered the 2P trick after hundreds of experiments. He also did the design that let Wrapp to produce the spike proteins.Wow, I'm super impressed by this piece of work you have done. You can convey the message about such complicated topics in a very clear way.Thank you for this great video. Could you tell us whether the concentration of neutralizing antibody is an indicator of vaccine efficacy? Or does it just have to reach a certain level in order to be good enough?Great work, I would love to see such a video for the next steps as well. Thank you!Thanks Jason. I appreciate what you guys do. I have been vaccinated twice. Biontech! I waa tested positive 3 days after the second vaccine. On my 11th day of the quarantine. Just felt tired and my fever climbed up to 37 at the first day and then it literally stopped. Havent felt anything since then.It's comforting to know that there are so many really smart people out there working to solve hard problems like this.This is exactly what I wanted to know. Thank you for making this excellent video!I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it’s definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!👍Congratulations! My attention span for this type of material usually doesn't last beyond about 4 minutes. Your animations are fantastic.Thank you joe for the video, man you are really talented in actually making people understand and diluting heavy concepts, and the way of presenting and talking, you should make videos of how to do that :(Imagine writing your phd and get to study a pandemic first hand...Fantastic video! So informative. So, I'm just curious, what else is actually in the vaccine serum that's injected? You've got the mRNA for the spike protein, and probably some sort of preservative, but is that it? If not, what else is in there? And how does the mRNA stay intact in the serum without denaturing?Thanks to Jason for all his work. Also thanks to Robert Malone for inventing this technology 35 years ago. Any mention of Robert and why he thinks we should not be giving this to everyone?Jason, thank you for such a great video.  Electron microscopes are so fascinating in the way they bounce off of the sample to create shadows....then pictures. Also, your explanation of the vaccine production is thorough and interesting.  Question:  I keep hearing about mRna and that the virus has genetic material made of Rna.  The mRna molecule is a copy of the genetic Rna strand in the Sars Cov2 virus, is that right?This video was finally the one that I could understand!! Thank you so much for what you do, guys :)Opened my eyes at least now I know about what it is and how it works all thanks to u great job to all the scientists and the helping handsIt's amazing how they simplify the explanation of the research about creation of the vaccine. Thanks for letting us, laymen, understand complex science stuffs.Thank you so much for this video! I know a lot of people are concerned but do you know if the vaccine contains luciferase?Captions must be in other languages to spread scientific knowledge. Videos like this could open minds all around the world. ✌🏼👍🏻Thanks, I really appreciate this explanation.  I am going to be vaccinated right now, God bless you guys !Awesome video and fascinating to see how this vaccine was developed!extremely well done, i've learnt a lot; thank youWe talked a lot about the biology of the coronavirus in my genetics class when we were learning about protein receptors and ligands. We learned about the spike protein but the machines shown in the video were new. The most common treatment proposed was reducing the number of proteins on the cell, but obviously that would have bad side effects. Seeing the parallels between what we explored in class and what actually happened is really cool.We need this video translated to other languages. There are people who fear the vaccine because they don't know what it is and how it works.Really great information to see how the vaccine is made and works. The molecular simulations are very helpful. Thanks.I learned a lot of this back during my undergraduate Biochemistry course, now after 3-4 years of working I’m going back with a passion to get my PhDThere are many heroes emerging during this pandemic.  These guys, arguably, are at the top of the heap!I worked with electron microscopes my entire life. I noticed that they just kept getting better and better. It seems that Cryo is now another huge step forward for electron microscopy.This is an AWESOME and TIMELY video. Thank you very much!

Can you please also create one on how scientists ensure the safety of vaccines? Much thanks!Amazing video! Hopefully will make people feel more trusting of the scientific community:)So Jason went from snowboarding with his family, to identifying a global threat in a phone call,  and then came up with a vaccine in less than a year - this guy is the real deal and the coolest hero in the World.Those researchers are the real MVP's in this whole situation. It has really opened my eyes to how important research is. Had they not been doing their work, we would be so far behind in this pandemic.We need more intelligent people like this.I wish I saw such content during high school.. ISTG I would have definitely taken my science classes more seriously....Whoever made these animations needs a raise. Perfectly explained.I wish this kind of videos is what the media told in the news. I've never felt so hopeful about COVID until this video. Well done!I’m trying to learn as much as I can about these vaccines, and this is absolutely the best video out there on how the vaccine came together.  I have shared this with many people.Outstanding, wonderous and amazing!! So very thankful for your hard work and this video.Great work! I'm going to show it to my patients!

I'm such a nerd- my first thought at @ 0:32 was, "But... It's an intramuscular injection!"This is so cool!!! Such innovation! and also easy to understand..  Great!!!I feel like this video should be on the evening news everyday to reduce fears of the vaccine and educate the public.Very good explanation of how a vaccine works but the last 30 seconds at the end of how we produce the vaccine i really would like to hear more aboutThis is the most informative video that I  have been able to find on the mRNA vaccine so far. Thank you.So helpful, thank you!Thanks so much for this! Now I understand science a little better.Got my first dose yesterday! Looks like we’re finally on the tail end of thisI am LOVING the mix of high-fidelity molecular mechanics animations, plus monty python-esque cartoons. THIS is the science education aesthetic I am here for :)I just want to thank them and every  other scientist working on this around the worldStrangely after contracting and fighting off COVID, my near anosmia (I’ve been relatively unable to smell things for at least a decade, with a few inconsistent exceptions) and spice tolerance have noticeably improved, without a noticeable deterioration in my ability to taste (I never lost my sense of taste during COVID, though smell remains uncertain given my near anosmia). 

For those curious my symptoms were as followed: 
*A Low Grade Fever: Strangely it never reached the health department’s temperature classification. 
*Backed Up Sinuses: It eventually reached a point where I could feel an acidic burning in my nostrils. (Definitely the most miserable symptom)
*General Body Aches: A typical symptom whenever I get a bad infection or cold. 
*Chills: Probably the least miserable of the symptoms.
*Headaches: Either caused by reduced sleep, or the infection. 
Each, lasted roughly two and a half to three days, and felt like a particularly miserable cold, only much worse and much more intense. 

I’m just glad I was fortunate enough to have such light symptoms, considering I was double at risk given my recently collapsed lung and my IGA deficiency.I'm gonna ask my parents for a science machine for Christmas.Will their research be published and accessible to the general public sometime soon?Very interesting science innovation, thanks for the research info..News Media: "A vaccine could take up to 10 years to develop..."

Scientists: "Actually we were 9 years into developing the thing when they cut our funding a decade ago"

News Media: "...oh look at that, we made a vaccine in just a year!"I LOVE SCIENCE! I've just discovered this channel, and I'm amazed by all of its superb quality material! It's a big pleasure to absorb real science!Wished he talked more about the mRNA mechanism, since the two that have been approved so far are mRNA vaccines, not a protein vaccine. Isn't this the first time mRNA vaccines have been approved for public use? Also curious if the immortal human cells were HeLa cells.Is it possible that you can produce the same informative video with a scientific basis into the many or a few instances where these vaccines cause problems within a recipient? I think it would serve to the credibility of your previous video which was very good but also help people understand that if something can go wrong these are the reasons potentially as to why it didI wish this video had more subtitles! Everyone needs to watch this :3Thanks. I like the explanation of what the mRNA aspect is for as other short explanations of it didn't quite click.If this guy was my science teacher in highschool, i would like science more. :)I work in healthcare as a licensed practical nurse.  This video is amazing!!!  We are about to be offered the Covid vaccine.  Many of us are still conflicted about getting it.2:56 giving up skying which is probably paid by the same work you’re asked to do instead is not a small thing you’ll. what a hard working scientist he is! 👏Very interesting.

This guy seems very well educated.One part that was unclear to me is yes it’s just the spike and not the full virus we are putting into our immune system but how does it train our body to know to destroy it?This video is wonderful. It really explains what a covid vaccine is and how it works . Great work 👏Thank you to the hardworking scientists <3 True HeroesIncredible work!This blew my mind keep up the great work! Insane there's this smart of ppl in the world!Does anyone know if during the clinical trials...those that got vaccinated... and testing positive for immunity... did they intentionally infect the volunteers to see how the vaccine protects them? Just curious how this process works... how do they know that the vaccine  is 95% effective?This is amazing! Thank you for the video!Honestly man, at this point i have learned more from youtube than school 😄It's so easy to forget how incredibly smart humanity is until you get reminded of it by such great feats of technology, innovaton, and science.Can you give the general public any idea how long it takes to make the vaccines  once the scientists make the formula?Two minor corrections:

1. The spike does not consist of one spike protein only but comprises three identical, intertwined spike proteins.

2. Coronaviruses are not named like that because they look like a crown, but because under a 1960s era electron microscope the discoverers of coronaviruses thought that they looked like the sun with a halo; since the halo of the sun is the sun's corona, they named them coronaviruses. "Particles are more or less rounded in profile; although there is a certain amount of polymorphism, there is also a characteristic "fringe" of projections 200 A long, which are rounded or petal shaped, rather than sharp or pointed, as in the myxoviruses. This appearance, recalling the solar corona, is shared

by mouse hepatitis virus and several viruses recently recovered from man, namely strain B814, 229E and several others." Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/220650b0I work in long-term care homes with at-risk elderly patients, I just got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday. I hate needles and all the conspiracy theories out there freaked me out, but I'm putting my trust in the scientists and scientific evidence. I also want to keep my old people safe <3 
I have experienced some side effects, my shoulder is sore (which is normal with any vaccine) and the injection site within an inch of where the needle went in has been feeling hotter than the rest of my arm, this started about 12 hours after I was vaccinated; the best way for me to describe it is that it feels like a sunburn. Other than that I haven't experienced any other effects. If anyone wants me to update this after my second dose to reassure you, please let me know.Thank you for making this. I've been sharing it with as many people as I can.Yesterday i got the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. First night who i sleep good after one year, thanks! ♥️It's such a relief having channels like this one, thank you for this video!Very informative 👏🏻This video was amazing, and that Doom reference made me smile which is something I needed today. Thank you guyssuch a wonderful informative videoJoking aside, this is freaking impressive!!!!!This video is fascinating and really helpful. I'm a teacher and I would love to share it with students and other teachers. There is one problem. I am in a Spanish speaking country and I will need subtitles to do so.
I wonder if maybe you can authorize to add subtitles to this video and contribute to reach a wider public specially with this kind of information.
There is a lot of missinformation and in spanish is way less access to this kind of content.Imagine that one grad student's resume.  "I helped research a cure for covid-19".  Probably gonna be an instant pick up most anywhere he applies.very informative and educational video THANKS FOR THIS"It would take months or even years" man I just hope those who are infected can make it until those timelinesthe concept of creating a vaccine is like how machine learning works.Inspiring. Great animations. Thank youI got fully vaccinated with AZ (astrazenaca) this sept, but i still curious about which vaccine is more effective. In my country there are some cases that people passed away after got the first dose. People then begin to think, it's because the vaccine. That makes people so worry to get vaccinated. Doctors and any people in charges said it wass because 'comorbid" or i don't know what is it.. i hope you make an explanations about thisA couple questions I have still unanswered after watching this video:
Once the protein spike is replicated in your body, how does your immune system come to recognize the spike as a foreign entity to target and destroy?  Does the protein spike cause damage to any of your cells/body in order to provoke the immune response?
Which of your cells are host to the mRNA and resultant protein spikes?  Do those cells go on producing the spikes as long as they live?  Could this cause problems in certain cell types such as nerves or eggs where the cell is never replaced and  expected to live as long as you do?
The video says that the method was found to be "safe".  I'd like to know what potential dangers were considered and monitored for during trials when that conclusion was come to.Thank you so much for making this kind of video!!!!This was amazing to watch!Is it possible that some spikes proteins can slip thru the cracks and not get mutated properly and thus cause adverse effects?Best fricken video on this topic ive seen. Very easy to understand. Great job.This needs more views! Thanks for this video - really helps!Thank you so much for this video! Without it, the vaccine was just a 'thing' with the face of a company being discussed politically. This made me feel more connected to the scientists behind its research. I really appreciate it.Complex concepts made simple.  This helps a lot.Imagine the fury from all the scientists working on this with all their knowledge on how it works and all the effort they put into this when they get told by someone that they won't get it because of what someone said on facebook.I appreciate the animation, it helps makes the video easier to understandTHANK YOU SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,  THANK YOU SCIENTISTSWouldn’t this shot just cause the corona virus to evolve a completely different intrusion mechanism?I was super nervous about the vaccine but  this video has made me feel more confident, and I'm totes gonna share it!I am sooo jealous....
As a scientist....Its like a dream to be able to work on stuff like this

He is an amazing personi m so appreciate all the hard work! thank you <3Got the moderrna vaccine and still got Covid bad ended up in hospital 4 days . Maybe the vax saved my life but  I was really scared when I had a 105.5 feverExcellent piece. Thank you.Thank you for this excellent video .. super well done, definitely fabulously informative ..!!  Merci pour cette excellente vidéo .. super bien faite, vraiment fabuleusement informative .. !!  ✨🙂💉💖👍Would love to see the look on his face when he hears that people refuse to take the vaccination 😭Amazing video. Thank you! I share it frequently.Freakin' awesome guys.  Thank you for saving lives.  Science rulez!So how is this spike any different than recovering from the actual virus? You body still learns how to fight the virus.Well done informative video. How does the rna integrate into our genes and get expressed and what are implications?Stay curious! Well said. That is what we shell be if we use acomplete new way of vaccine technology in contrast to conventional but safe vaccines against bladder (using harmless cow pox) or polio (using dead viruses or only proteins of them): its genetical engineering on human cell in vivo! Especially when using DNA vektors such as Astra Zeneca.We had to learn about this in my protein biology class. So glad that I can say I understood this! Made a B+ in that course toovideo is 11 mins 50 seconds but it took me an hour to watch as I try and soak up as much information as I can. Great useful videoNurses and people in the medical industry are already getting vaccinated by the way. 

Can you guys make a video on the mRNA vaccines? Unless the companies making it are keeping it confidential, of course.I received the first dose of the vaccine and thanks to this video I now have a better understanding of why and how the vaccine works.Can someone tell me why these spikes need to go to wall vessels of our brain or other vital ordans (except the lungs) when the virus does not go there? That's the problem with the blood clothsI cannot give this video enough likes. It's unfair that I can only like it once.

There should be an exception policy for content this good that allows us to like it multiple times.Great video! So academics did the research and published for all to see? Then Pfizer and other companies took the base research and manufactured it ..or? Did they add something new/different to it? What is the funding/money flow structure throughout all of this?This was the best video I saw on how the Vaccine works. Such clear and fun explnation. 
New to your channel, eager to see more!Questions I have: 1)You have to form a cluster of proteins to make that shape.  How do you know that all the proteins will be read out from the mRNA and then get together and fold into the proper shape? 2) What happens to misfolded proteins, will be body recognize them and dispose of them properly? 3) What happens when there is an anomaly like a fever, will heat shock proteins get involved and reform these clusters or turn them into mutants?  

It is way too risky for my body!  If the virus were more lethal, I'd consider it....but not now.The science is absolutely incredible. But, how much in body testing is there? So cool that research has been in progress for so long to help stop the current pandemic. I will get it but I would rather be one of the later ones (I'm not at risk nor am I around anyone who is).Why would anyone dislike this video.... honestly 🤦🏾‍♂️How interactive, gripping, humorous is Joe!!! I love being smart and curious😂😂😉😉Thank you. After watching it 3 times, I got it. Just amazing. I guess Jason and them vaccinated themselves first😂😂Thank you so much for this video!Great video I’ll be sending to my grandma to try to convince her to get one!Great video, the visual is really helpful!I'm not.
Not once did I hear what is in it. The ones getting hurt or sick are probably wishing they hadn't done it.
    Hope you that have taken it stay well.This guys resume:

"I created Covid19 vaccine"Great video
 I've been sharing it with my familywow.. science is wonderful.. imagine how many disciplines it takes to build all those stuff... I feel like a dot of dust, or probably a mere electron now :DGreat video, thank you.Your last line brought a tear to my eye.  I am ready for this to be over too, I'm ready for people to stop dying, I'm ready for my parents to be able to hug and kiss their grand children.  I'm ready for the world to be safe again.This is just brilliant.I will probably need to watch this at least ten times to understand about 5% of it but it's ok to be smart-ish!10:00 Really cool video, it really does explains how the vaccine got done so fast, I guess my only concern would be the mRNA sequence, It’s really amazing but it’s really concerning having my body can turn into a factory of this (spike protein), like how  many will it make?... will it stop?.. or for how long will it make them, will it be permanent?....I enjoyed watching your video. Seeing the different machines and insight into the process ! ThanksThank you. I feel far more educated now... I've been sceptical about all this dramaAs always a super good videoSo those dudes deserve a nobel prize and maybe a few morePhenomenal! As an engineer, I wish I had design input into that microscope...Thank you! Knowledge is the antidote to fear.Thank you sir, You are kind hearted Gentleman.MORE PEOPLE SHOULD WATCH THISThe invention of the mRNA  (messenger RNA) method basically comes from Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman. They have the names on the patent (2009). The rights are not theirs though, first they went to their Institution ((Univ of Pennsylvania), which then sold the rights. I hope the inventors will at least receive a Nobel prize.Got my vaccine today. No horrific side effects. Just felt a little strange. Get vaccinated!That "You are the factory" line really made me go "wow, that is so awesome", really makes you appreciate people working on this stuff huh?*Biology is the most interesting thing but people read and study it pretty less they think it's only for doctors*This is definitely the best video I have seen on this topic so far! Thumbs up, will definitely share this on my social media feed!Science is amazing!Finally a video about coronavirus that is somewhat honest and doesn’t tell us to “trust us” every 5 minsI love the positive message at the end🙏 so many haters growing on the mediaMan that was the beat and easy to understand video I ever seen, I speak Spanish and I wish I can translate it for my Spanish speaking friends , please let me know if somebody already did it, kudos to you, beat video on vaccine everOhhhhh my god that is awesome!!!!! Gotta research more on thisVery informative  thxVery nice and informative!  
Indeed - as a community we should all support basic research to not be caught unawares when such catastrophes strike.Got the first shot yesterday, big thanks to all the scientists working on it for saving hundreds of million lifesHoping that this pandemic ends asap!This is the type of video we need, thank youWow, truly mesmerising ❤️❤️❤️ॐ सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः
सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः।
May all sentient beings be at peace|
may no one suffer from illness|

We Indians are happy for both of our Indian vaccines (covaxin and covishield). We are also happy to provide it to our neighbors for free. Indians are proud of their doctors and scientists. Hope we also supply vaccines to west world asap.Wow. Amazing video 👏🏻Thanks for everyone who commit themselves to make the covid-19 vaccine! ❤️🙏Ended the video just a bit too soon.  I would like to hear about the physiological mechanisms involved with becoming a factory of producing viral spike proteins and how that translates into training an immune system. What in my body is using the mRNA? How long does it make it for? What happens to the part of my body that is used to make viral spike proteins?Stuff like this restores my faith in humanityHow do you know if COVID-19 was not designed in a lab and deployed as a weapon?  Or maybe they found it in the ice and then deployed it as a weapon?Your last statement is extremely important. Supporting basic research is so important.HI! well presented thank you. Because we are the factory for the spike protein and it is in our RNA does that mean that is in us forever and our body will continue to replicate these spike proteins for the rest of our life? Is there a "turn off" switch? Then as the virus mutates and we change our spike protein each season what will these excess proteins do to our bodies? Secondary effects? Could these treatments lead to hyperproteinemia or other conditions? Could you make a video addressing some of these questions and concerns? Thank you.Doesn't that cause auto-immune disease as body attacks part of itself that way?Would it be possible to mix the protein vaccine and mRNA vaccine to produce a better effective vaccine?The beginning of the end of the pandemic is in effect. 
Keep hope alive, people!Fascinating video! I shared it in my Facebook profile.Thank you scientists for working hard!this feels like a whole sci-fi movieAmazing. May Allah bless all efforts for the benefits of others and guide all to happiness ever afterAll I can say now is: I hope you're right...I'm getting old, these scientists look 10 years old. Lol.
God bless them.Every time I hear about the immortal cell I can't help but get upset knowing how they stole them from a Black woman named Henrietta Lacks. They never gave her or her family any of the billions of dollars her cells have made since she passed from cervical cancer; where they got these immortal cells from. Thank you Henrietta, for this and any other future vaccine that saves millions lives. Also, thank you to Jason and the other scientist working in the lab.But it's kinda sad that a lot of people still don't know how vaccine works 🙁This is the best use of your free time. Best 11 mins of my day.Good presentation.  But what of the inconsistency in the cov-2 spike proteins?  And what's this about the vaccine being prophylactic and not suitable for a pandemic?  On the former, slightly off spike proteins are a bad fit for vaccine spikes, where they can dislodge within a macrophage turning that into a virus factory, multiplying the viral load above the original output?  Could be the same with variants from differing locations that could trigger same as well.We just going to ignore how well edited that effect was at 7:50?Can you do a video on immortal human cells? If you have already done one, can you share a link please?whenever jesser uploads my day gets betterJesses content has been on a whole different level domain univers and every other adjectiveSup Jesser, these challenge videos are amazing and They are amazing to watch thanks for great contentI look forward to Jesse's posts.

Will is a f cking goat for exposing this part of himself and sharing something thats extremely humiliating. Social media is filled with face-tuned IG pics, highlight reels etc etc - it's good to see something real on the internet again.Mad respect to you Will! Thank you for sharing this powerful documentary/biography. 
I’ve also been going through a lot of challenges this year, and just seeing how you pushed yourself, Overcoming your struggles and challenges is really motivating. Thank you for always being an inspiration to us all. ✊🏾🙏🏾♥️So happy you are sharing this health odyssey with the world, Will.Will, thank you for sharing this. ALL OF THIS! ALL OF YOU! The number of lives you are impacting with this is phenomenal. So many people try to hide the hard parts, the ugly parts (which are actually the most beautiful parts) of growth. Thank you for being real with this! Much love and respect to you for being who you are and having the courage to share this journey 💙 Absolute legend!I 100% feel what Will is feeling. It is extremely stressful working so hard to lose weight and nothing happens. The pain you feel in your soul is realHe is great. So inspirational. I trained 12 weeks just because of your challenge. Thank you, Will!Will for what it’s worth I want to thank you so much for doing this. Sharing this experience hits way too close to home for me and I am in the process of doing the same thing of going for a drastic body transformation. When I was younger even my PCP accused me of being on steroids because I was a gym rat and in the best shape of my life. As the years went by I felt victim to “dad bod” also and hate my current situation. Knowing it can happen to literally anyone esp you helps me push though this even hard. Bless you and thank you again.Ugh. I feel your frustration Will. As we get older our bodies change and it’s harder to find motivation. Setbacks like gaining a pound your first week when you know you crushed your workouts are frustrating and make it even more difficult to stay focused. Keep your head up. We are all rooting for your success. You’ve already succeeded in my mind! Getting off the sofa! Step 1, success!!!!184 lbs to 164 lbs in 11 weeks, called it this week (the 30th week) at 147 lbs.

Starting BMI: 26.4.
Ending BMI: 21.09

It's possible. Exercise helps, but how much you eat matters more. Learn your basic metabolic rate and your TDEE, then work with your doctor to formulate a weight-loss plan and ask questions. I exercised lightly (lightly active job + 30 min walks around the neighborhood) but I didn't do anything that required equipment. My diet is terrible still, but I was eating the minimum number of calories required for my activity level and I stopped snacking. 

It's easier than you think.I cannot tell you enough how amazing this is Mr. Smith. You will never know how many lives you have touched with all of the shows, movies, laughter, and music, but I can tell you that your openness and honesty here outweighs all of them. This is so real and raw, showing the truth behind all of the smoke and mirrors. You are one of a kind, and the world is a better place from your vulnerability. Thank you for giving us this gift.I feel honored that he's even sharing this. At a time we need real stories and experiences to motivate us.Wow this was a pleasant surprise in transparency. Having been in the entertainment industry as well, dealing with weight gain, weight loss, injuries, I share all the emotional weight here. Keep it up Will, love to you and yours.Keep us posted Will!! You will surely succeed!! You have awaken the fighter in me!! Thank you 🙏🏽A celebrity that is willing to let us see the real person. I’ve ALWAYS loved how genuine he is. We love you thanks for letting us in.The best thing I love about Will is that when he's funny, I laugh sooo hard, but then he's got this serious side that just wows me, his words touch my whole soul, and I just cry so hard.Wow this was refreshing and inspiring. Getting back in shape at 40+ is tough, staying there is too.
I dropped 45 lbs 10 years ago, quit the smokes and started running. I'm now a singer and an avid half-marathoner.
It's hard but I am so freaking glad I did this.I can totally relate pushing 50 myself and you do compare yourself to your younger version and it gets discouraging.  I also gained pounds when I first started trying to lose weight.  Keeping it off and self control is the next challenge.  Thanks for sharing.A lot of respect to Will for this and giving a glimpse of the struggle of trying to get in shape. In a lot of times, people do not show this side of the coin like this and the training is usually a montage of sped up clips of the training and then the results. Losing weight and getting in shape is no joke. Even with all the personal trainer and equipment, the process itself is very tough and can even be stressful and depressing at time. Great show. Keep it up.I connected with so many moments here. Talking to your younger self who set the foundation for today, and thinking I owe him more! The personal development tapes and books don't seem to have the same effect anymore for me! This video sparked something in me to  move again. Love you Will!“I’m at a calorie deficit and I’m in here crying every day.” I felt that so much."The funnier the person, the greater the pain"  I felt that .I’m hooked! This is going to be a fantastic show/experience to witness.  I wish I had a means to have been involved.   I think I could have been helpful to him with this endeavor.   I’m over 50 myself, was hit by a truck, and wound up losing everything right before Covid.   I have since gone homeless and live out of my car.  I found the most physically demanding job that I could (working at a landfill as general labor).   Every day is a struggle.  At the end of every day, I’m exhausted.   But I still train 4-5 days a week.  It’s amazingly difficult, yet I am the happiest, healthiest, and the most optimistic I’ve been for as long as I can remember … I am getting a completely different perspective of life.  I’m lucky to be here.   I wish I could have been able to influence Mr. Smith.  Maybe someday though.   You never know 😁Losing weight and staying in shape has little to do with age. However I will admit it does get more difficult as you age but it all comes down to lifestyle and state of mind. People who blame covid for weight gain are shifting the focus off their poor choices. I am 43 years old and was pushing 200 lbs going into covid. Simple things were beginning to get difficult for me to do. Granted, 200lbs is not seriously obese, but I didn’t mention that I am only 5’7”. 

I decided to do something about it. I started off simple, only changing my diet to start with. Making healthy choices, making sure not to eat a few hours before going to sleep, reducing portion sizes. I did NOT count calories, just eating healthier things. I lost 15 lbs in about 2 months. I then began to do intermittent fasting, my fasts lasted anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. I would fast once about every week to a week and a half. Keep in mind, up until now I have not yet to increase my daily physical activity, just my eating habits. Fasting the first time was difficult because I did not know what to expect. Subsequent fasts were much easier. I encourage everyone to research the amazing health benefits of intermittent fasting, you will be amazed.

One key note on my experience with fasting. Before changing my diet to a more healthy diet, if I had gone an extended period of not eating due to being busy or what have you, for say 7 or 8 hours, I would get dizzy or feel light headed or a general feeling of weakness. I don’t know for a fact, but I believe it was some form of effects from low blood sugar. I assume this because I could eat a candy bar or a piece of fruit or just drink a “sugary” drink and it would almost immediately subside. So I was concerned with how fasting would go. Fortunately I suffered NONE of these symptoms during my first fast or any of my many fasts up to present. I attribute it to having changed my diet to a more healthy diet months prior to my first fast. I had already cut out most of the unhealthy processed sugars that I used to eat. No medical proof to back this up, just my experience.

I continued this for about 4 months. At this point eating healthy and intermittent fasting became a habit and easy to keep up with. I had lost another 10 lbs or so and my weight stabilized at a range of about 172 to 175lbs. As of about 3 weeks ago I have implemented weight lifting and yoga. I plan to begin cardio very soon. My target weight is between 165 and 170lbs. Small changes are the key.. small changes with consistency so they become habit, then another small change. 

I am so much happier when I look in the mirror, but the biggest satisfaction is from how good I feel. I feel rejuvenated, full of energy throughout the day, my clothes fit better and my body feels better. Anyone can do this, you just need to make a choice to do it, and it HAS to be for YOU, not for anyone else. Take the time to INVEST in yourself. I BELIEVE in YOU, so BELIEVE in yourself! I hope my story helps someone, you CAN do it.

Edit: I also wanted to add one more note about my experience with fasting. During my fasts, I surprisingly did not feel drained or weak at any time. Quite the opposite actually. I was taken aback by how energetic I felt during the whole process. The hardest thing at first was the hunger. It would hit hard at first, during the time periods where I would normally be having a meal. The hungry feeling would generally last about 10 to 15 minutes, then it would go away. This seemed to continue in cycles every few hours, especially if I was not actively doing something as in just sitting around watching tv and such. However I did notice that each cycle got weaker and weaker, meaning it was easier to cope with. Many times I could dampen it by chugging a bottle of water. I later found out that there is a chemical that your body releases that creates the hungry feeling, you should look that up too, its quite interesting. Now that I am used to it and understand what it is and why I’m feeling it, I have NO issues fasting, it gets too easy. I have actually done a few 48 hour fasts and could have gone longer but I had already pre-decided when I was going to end the fast.This is a show a lot of us men & women need man! I appreciate the openness and vulnerability here!! I’m tuning into this whole series & book!You have to remember that your metabolism will kick in if you keep exercising so in the beginning it might seem like your not making much progress, but if you keep at it you will see the difference. I've also always been conscious of my body...I'm 34 now and I still exercise.  I know how difficult it can be to start from the bottom again. Now I can tell my body has changed so I have to maintain it and try and be more careful of what I consume. I want to keep healthy for my kids so I can enjoy my time with them as much as possible. Much love Will I've always been a fan your an amazing person don't ever forget that.I love that his show encourages losing weight the right way. No surgery, no pillsYou got this brother.    If there’s one thing I’ve learned,  if you don’t leave that gym beginning for mercy, if your body isn’t shaking,  if you can get in your car without a problem, work harder, the body can take so much more than we give it credit for, the mind is the only weakness,  break the cycle push the mind , push the body till you Physically and mentally can’t give any more.Inspirational! I'm sure he hasn't forgotten how he trained for "Ali". He just like a lot of us with "Dad bods" just so happened to find extra lbs around the house and now it's time to take it back! But I would have loved to see he and Martin Lawrence  do the "Bad Boys for life!" thing in real life and go through this together, even if they don't live in the same city!I'm definitely not just rooting for his success but his happiness as well. 
Will Smith is proving to be an amazingly genuine and real man and I hope that in all this he finds joy in himself no matter how things turn out physically ❤Man you can really see the pain in his eyes that he Carrie’s everyday not bc of the show but bc of his personal life and how it has changed drastically this past year or two"The funnier the person, the greater the pain."

Oof. Robin Williams.This was great. However, Will shouldn't have depended on only body weight to gauge his success. He looked discouraged at the end of that first week and I wanted to tell him maybe that's just water weight, or, with all that resistance training, he put on muscle... without knowing that kind of stuff, it's hard to see exactly what progress is going on (or not). But by this point it's past 20 weeks so I'll see what happens in the rest of this series.I really appreciate Will for showing the process. Everything he’s going through with his weight loss journey (reflecting on your younger body, working hard but not seeing the scale change, the self criticism, the disappointment, etc) is completely relatable. Most celebrities just show up on IG with a new body like it’s easy. It’s not.I used to be really fat. I was on the verge of developing some serious health conditions. I remember not being able to tie my shoelaces and my sleep suffered as well. My life changed when I finally set my mind to the thinking that anything is possible if you decide so. I took a meal plan to start with. I created it on Nextlevel diet, which was super helpful at the time. I didn't have to worry about calories, macros, nutrients and all that stuff. I just focused on walking long distances and exercising after I got on a level where I could do some simple workouts. I hope my story will inspire you to do the same. To change your body you must first change your mind!!When I stopped caring  about what people thought of me is when I dropped 15lbs. No joke. No diet. I actually struggle to keep weight on. Mental health is health :) love Will Smith. Take care y’allWill Smith is such a humble guy and you can tell that there is a lot of pain in those eyes. We need more real role models like this who are willing to expose that fragile part of themselves over these insta models who portray their life as perfectThe level of humility it takes to make something like this is inspiring on all levels.Wow 😮! So real and amazing like all your work, I’ve loved you since day one and as I grow up along with your work. This is by far the most beautiful, outstanding best work you’ve done so far. Your have my true  admiration. Thank you for sharing such personal and honest experience. I also want to try to be at my best weight in my life. Here I go 2022!! 🙏🧘‍♀️♎️This is REAL.  Thankyou for showing me your pain. You didn’t have to, but you showed me I’m not alone. Thanks man 😔🙏🏾 i needed to see thisAbout a year ago I hit the worst depression I’ve had in a long time. And I lost all the muscle I had gained in the gym because I stopped working out. It got so bad that I don’t even recognize myself anymore. I want to get in the best shape of my life mentally and physically. This really inspired me to give it all I’ve got this time. I’m tired of being skinny and soft. I wanna be built and toned.As someone part of the healthcare industry, it frustrates me seeing the ending of this episode. The disappointment in the results a scale gives someone as it crushes their dreams of an accomplishing week. There are so many factors that can go into a 1lb gain that isn't discussed which could easily change the demeanour of this video and his journey of getting to his target weight. He could be feeing 100 times better than the start of the week, yet just because of that single number at the end, his mindset is crushed, which is how most of society will feel. I hope people will look at the intangibles of physical activity, rather than the straight up number, which could be misleading for the most part, because of muscle mass gain, or just literally what you ate or drank the night before, to being slightly more stressed at the end of the week.

 My bad on the rant, but this seems to be a big platform so many people will see this video, not many will read this, but hopefully it'll push some to continue with the grind for a healthier life.The funnier the person the greater the pain... looing for ward to the transformation. cheering for you Will, great fam you have there.Nice to see such honesty rather than the usual social media life is always great nonsense. Great piece of work 👍I’ve always loved how real and genuine you are. It’s your constant evolution and introspection that makes you an enigma. You are a living legend.We have ALL suffered Covid -19 extra pounds, Mental and physical shame etc. Your tummy is hurtful to you. .mine is wayyyy off the mark. You are right about all of what you have said. I am glad you have kept this real and showed EVERYBODY how we can begin to heal ourselves. Thank you Will, your family should be proud of you.I think your biggest power is being an example, setting new goals and crossing the limits...thank you and thanks for keeping it free for everyone. 😃This is actually a very important message especially for people who are getting older and they see their body isn't the same as it was back in their 20s or something. When you're young, you think you're invincible and you're usually in the best shape of your life. But we get older and things change and sometimes we start to miss our old bodies.I love Will, he's a great human.you are extraordinary, mr. smith. no matter what weight or state of mind, your open eyes and reasoning mind are extraordinary. thank you for sharing with us all.Wow, that was interesting, inspiring and mindful at the same time. Thank you very much for your insights, see you in the next episode. Cheers, Michael.Como no va a poder bajar de peso, si tiene lo mejor de lo mejor. Es ponerle onda todos los días sin importar las circunstancias .I don't think I've ever identified with a celebrity so much as in that last shot. Seeing all the work, focus,  and intention amount to the feeling of going backward. I've felt that. I wish I was there to grieve that moment as a fellow human.The world needs this. You're teaching people how to be authentic. How to heal.  I'm really proud of Will and what he is putting out in to the world. I can't wait to read his book.This man.............. IS A LEGEND.Oh you could tell he was hurting when his weight was measured… I wish I could’ve comforted him.. his expectations were that his body would react the exact same way as it had when he was 10-15 years younger.. also, it generally takes time for good results to even begin! His trainer should’ve known better. As long as he keeps fighting, he will be okay. So far, this is a GREAT episode.Even though you probably won’t see this, just wanted to let you know that you changed the way I look at life!! Thank you so much brother!!!Damn Will. That opening letter was powerful. I’ve never felt a celebrity explain how I’ve felt so deeply before, that was crazy.Will, love you man.  Keep your head up.  You're an inspiration.   #freewillsmithI love your whole family. I feel we are entering this age of authenticity, and your family is diving right in. I binge watched all episodes, and cannot wait until I can afford your book. Thank you for being vulnerable and authentic, Will. I know how difficult it can be, especially when it comes to taking accountability for our parenting with our children, let alone letting the whole world watch it. Heroic.Thanks for making this. Going through some similar mental and physical challenges too.He is one of the best actor, father & human being...I can connect with Will. 
One you hit your late 40’s and 50’s, what used to come easy seems unattainable. Will has always been in incredible shape. Once you stop, it seems gone forever. To reach that goal it takes total commitment, and what we all lack, patience. I work overseas in Africa, I will never reach that level of fitness again. It’s good to see Will push thru. It’s a mental game. Not seeing the results quick as we used to sucks the drive out of you. 
Will, incredible change physically and mentally! Your an inspiration to us old boys!!!Watching you feels like I seeing myself was and now my son is also like that. 
always try to hide the sadness, uncomfortable part of his feelings with laughter and jokes.you just gave me the push I needed this whole time. you showed me that I'm not alone in struggling to try harder. I deeply appreciate it that you're sharing it with us.Losing weight and maintaining fitness after your twenties is extremely hard. Well done.!Just take one thing from this....if this man has every advantage...training, nutrition, team of trainers.... and he is still struggling.  You are not failing alone. Keep trying....keep failing....keep yourself in focus. It's not easy. It's not fun. But you're worth it.His energy is so bright and bubbly. It breaks my heart to see him so crushed at the end. We've all been there, especially after being in lockdown for the guts of 2 years. Life is tougher these days than it's ever been. I'm so proud of Will for opening up to us and really dropping the curtain on his life and reminding the world how important our mental and physical health is. They really do play a part in everything and it's an everyday struggle. You got this Will! Sending love, light and positivity your way ❤💫🇺🇸 🙋‍♂️You go Will, great message to all 🙏I grew up watching Will. Aspiring to be like him with his intelligence and determination. I love to getting to see him in a new light. It definitely grounds my concept of him. Makes him human and not bigger than life. A man trying to rebuild himself mentally and physically with a set goal in his head.Weight, age... theyre just numbers.  You are achieving greatness!  Much respect.This series shoes how hard Will is on himself - the same as a lot of us. But it takes holding yourself to that standard to achieve his level of greatness. You've done it before, you can do it again. It's just going to take a little more work.I think it's cool for people to see that even people who have "everything" still struggle with parts of life. Good on Will for opening up and sharing his struggles. He doesn't have to do that. It helps everyday joes get past their own issues and insecurities. Thanks, Will!I understand, I am 58 years old and I have gotten to 234. I am trying to get back in shape by myself. I applaud you.Don't think I've ever seen him this vulnerable before. It just shows at the end of the day that we're all human.I don’t care what the media says and I don’t care about his relationships. He will always be my favorite actor. I grew up watching Will and seen all of his movies and I’m buying his book too. Pursuit of Happyness, I Robot, I am Legend, Collateral Beauty are my favorite movies and  I could go on but the list is too long. Thank you Will for sharing this journey with us. I’m on a weight loss journey as well.When it comes to people with significant amounts of fat, weight is a good rubric of health and losing the fat should be the main target without wasting away any non fatty parts of the body - not losing muscle. Although Will gained 1 pound, it likely wasn't fat and he even looks slightly more toned - at least around his abdominals. Will will inevitably lose the weight if my theory is correct as his new muscle will burn more calories even at rest as long as he keeps the effort up, although now he has to lose 21 pounds in 19 weeks. He'll definitely be the fittest he has ever been.I think a lot of us can relate during covid, good time to fix up, thanks will!As someone who battles with their body image and mentally struggles to get themselves back into the shape they were in before gaining all this weight during COVID, this is so inspiring yet hard to watch as I’m sure we (all those watching) can relate in one or many ways with the struggles and mental toughness that it takes to break through that barrier to reach our full potential and be mentally and physically happy.A True inspiration i Luv you will smith 💪This was such a beautiful, well put together episode, and it absolutely motivates me to better myself in a way I've never been motivated before. I'm extremely honored that you've given us the opportunity to go on this journey with you 🙏 ❤Oh my god, I feel his pain when he realizes he doesn't lose weight. He tries to hide it with humor but his eyes give him away. I just wanted to hug him in that moment.Muscle weighs more. It’s just his body finding it again. That’s why he gained weight at 1st. I have confidence in him, I’m surprised the trainer didn’t reassure him with this.Will me siento muy muy identificado contigo, eres un gran ídolo pero deja de revelar los secretos de los que nos ocultamos con el humor jajajajYou're so inspiring Will - I've ALWAYS loved your work and continue to seek it. I've been fighting with the same 50lbs of excess weight for so many years now... this pushes me to fight harder. Thank you for sharing your journey. Be gentle to yourself - you're an amazing man. Your weight doesn't define you regardless of the spotlight. <3Mad respect to you Will! Thank you for sharing this powerful documentary/biography. 
I’ve also been going through a lot of challenges this year, and just seeing how you pushed yourself, Overcoming your struggles and challenges is really motivating. Thank you for always being an inspiration to us all. ✊🏾🙏🏾♥️"The funnier the person, the greater the pain."

Oof. Robin Williams.Despite gaining weight you can still tell Will had rather muscular legs/armsMan, there's a lot pain in his eyes. The comedy really is an armour/defense mechanism.Hi Will! I am reading your book 📕 and you posed a question pg. 243.(Gigi meets Jada) I agree with Jada nothing was funny. However, the way you talked about how life is about memories, you’re mad now but it wears off, we’re going to get married, have kids, and it’s a story was hilarious 😂. Comedic genius. Enjoy your day! 🥰19:13 is the moment where you realize the man that we all love who is Will Smith is as beautifully broken and human as every single one of us.  Keep pushing through Will, we know you can do it, and we are inspired by your drive, persistence, and willingness to better yourself.hes still the fresh prince no matter how old he gets😀Watching Will push himself just might be what I need to push myself out of this depression-hole I’ve dug myself in 2020-21. Thanks Will.Will don't worry whatever is your shape. We love you man!!! Real Love :heart:I'm 61 
I used to be a judo competitor and champion during my twenty's 
Like the majority of judo athletes I gained lot of weight 
At the age of 54 after successfully  rising alone 3 children, I decided to adopt my fourth child . 
At the age of 58 I got hit by reality 
I wasn't going to be alive to deliver my forth child to the society, like I delivered Aisha my first daughter at the age of 24, or at list not be able to stand at her graduation  for my eightieth birthday. 
Because of that fear, 
I got in shape within 2 years, and today I'm stronger than I was in my twenty's  
I got a body fat pourcentage of a 25 years old young man. < 12% 
Every thing is controlled by our mind, and our mind is controlled by our raison. 
Get a good and sharp reasoning and you'll be able to accomplish everything your mindset targeted.I used to train 6 days a week 7 hours a week before Covid from the age of 17 to 33 i was in the best shape of my life. Since Covid hit in March 2020 i haven't done anything lost muscle and gained fat, i effected me mentally and physically i have lost all confidence. Will showing his body going through a transformation has given me inspiration, i re joined the gym today to find my old self and hopefully will start feeling and looking better. Thanks Will you are a legend.I'm practically the same age --- I gave up smoking - changed my diet to vegetarian/vegan --- in 10 weeks I lost 40-45 ... he will do it - plus I was exercising - now alot moreWhen society talks about health, the only measurement is weight and looks. But a healthy human can't be just measured by that. If you have a few extra pounds, but you feel great about who you are, and what you do and your mental health is in great shape, it's 10000% healthier for you. Mental health is an equally important factor we should always consider when getting in shape. How healthy are your relationships? Family, friends, work. Do you even have healthy relationships? Are you happy with what you are doing with your life? Is it fulfilling for yourself? Does the daily workout really make you happy or is it torture for you? You can buy a lot of things, but nobody can buy time. Once it's used, it's gone. So you better choose wisely. CheersHis strength in being THIS vulnerable is LEGENDARY.  I can't think of anyone else who can make addressing men's mental health more consumable for people..   You are changing things.  This is worth it ❤Hi Will I’m a huge fan and I know this a really weird way to ask to be on a video or be on anything but I suffered a lot of the same issue except I lost 90 lbs with in the year of 2021 and I feel it would be awesome to talk about the opposite of the someone that’s behind cameras and I know that sounds really pretentious but I’m 21 a and I’ve struggled a lot with depression and I’ve never done anything like this but I really want to get attention to people who can also relate heavily towards working in their goals in 2022Well done Will, you've inspired me.. 
I lost 90lbs 3 years ago and felt amazing, A couple of injuries and covid and now i've put it all back on, nobody to blame but myself.
I feel like crap, I look like crap but only I myself can do something about. 
Tomorrow is a new day and I'm starting again. 
Thank you for helping me find some motivation.“I just gotta be aggressive, beeee aggressive”😭😭 Will is hilariousEven the most privileged cannot hide from their inner demons. I think it's really dope that you are willing to share your pain with us, Will. You're not a coward at all by the way. If anything you're even more of an inspiration for those who struggle with their mental health like me. Big salute to you... 🙏🏿🖤Will can do it. He's still my favorite actor in Hollywood period. You can do it Will just focus weight loss is a mindset. Best of luckThis story resonates a lot with most of us. I was an athlete prior to COVID and sitting on the couch with no gym , job , etc. was devastating. I am excited to watch this.I fully respect mr Smith for being this raw!...so refreshing!   I, as many others too I assume, are in exactly this same position...over 50 and over weight....but not able to afford gyms/personal trainers, etc..... anyone go thru that recently?  Anyone willing to give some advice/insight for starting this same path?!  Would love some feedback from someone who has done this without spending extra dollars and "on their own"....Thanks.....And on to episode 2!! HahahInspiring. I feel like this man has been there for me my whole life and he doesn’t even know it. Thanks Will.I’m in my 40s in he has definitely inspired meIs it just me or can you see a difference within his first week because I most certainly did! Maximum respect to Will for sharing this. Being on a fitness journey myself along with family issues combined, I can relate to the disappointment in oneself after training so hard and not obtaining the results initially.  I literally teared up. In this current social media climate of 'FACKERY' I appreciate this transparency more than you'll ever know!  Will Smith 'YOU ARE LEGEND!'This, Will, is awesome!!Hes dealing with how we all been feel he makes me want to lose all that I gained on lock downDamn this hits home every thing he said about hiding himself I feel the same way. This man truly is a legend.  Stay strong be you and change is inevitable.Just turned 50 today and I relate on so many levels. Weight, fatherhood, and also the desire to make people laugh. I look forward to seeing where the show goes. I hope the vulnerability and honesty stay even if the weight goes.I feel this. Marine, athletic and proud. At least I thought I was.

2020 ruined that and I came back in 2021, saw 224lbs on the scale at 5'8" and now I'm at 180.

Mental health and physical health are a priority to maintain. 

YOUR GREATEST WEALTH IS YOUR HEALTH!The crazy thing is he actually doesn't even look fat. He just looks bloated. I'm over here on a journey to lose 35lbs.No matter what shape you are, me , my sister in law and many , many others love you!
I sent this link to my sister in law, she is living in Kyrgyzstan and doesn’t speak English but I still sent it to her, because she is a biggest fan of yours!
God Bless you and your family! ❤️He is always going to be a legend. For his honesty. For his perception of the world. For how he helps others every day wether it be through laughter OR his story and truth. Vulnerability is what makes you whole. To be human you need every emotion. That’s what makes us unique. That’s what makes us survive. 🥰This is helping me evolve!  I was on hard drugs for 30 years and now I’ve been sober 3. I hit rock bottom. Eating out of trash cans sleeping on the streets of California for for almost 2 decades. I’m now married and in new career making 90K. I’m now grasping for encouragement to keep going on this new path. My past is hunting me Down like prey. This show is very encouraging. Will Smith you’ve always been an encouraging force in my life and I don’t even know you. I’ve been rocking with you since the 80’sBro. The transparency is divine and it will help a lot of people. We all in the same boat trying to row our boats ashore. Keep doing what you doing My BrotherIt's sad to see Will unhappy.
The man that has brought Billions of people so much joy.
I have grown up watching will from his very start and as strange as it is to say...he's family....just a family member you will never meet.
However it is a normal part of life, everyone has their lessons to learn, do your best, the fight is always with yourself and no one else.Wow, when i saw you back ago in the movie I am legend, it was like whoa, I need to get the same body fat value... it's very difficult to keep it but you inspire us with your honest input!Which tiktok stars should we react to next? Let us know in the comments!I love how honest Jax is lolI honestly like her. She’s very cute and there’s just something about her facial expression that’s just kinda satisfying? Kinda like how people like ASMR or soap cutting. The crazy thing how so many people attack her for not having talent, yet nothing that gets viral needs talent. People like it, people watch it.This girl doesn't deserve her fame, yet... she doesn't really deserve the hate either. It's hard to hate someone for no fault of theirs, but it's hard to like someone for undeserved fame as well.Her videos are cute. Her videos are viral. She served our country. Mad respect for her. There’s always going to be hate. You go and bop-bop-bop your head Bella ❤️The fact that the girls here are getting mad at Jax for saying that she’s hot is so stupid. He had a totally fair argument saying she’s only popular because she’s attractive; same with the guy creators.Its because of her facial expression. She can mimic animated characters mannerism and reaction. Quite fascinating to watchI love how honest and straight forward Jaxon is lmao5:20 *"She don't deserve all the hate, She's literally just doing the same thing everyone does in Tiktok"* 








You're right!"STOOOOP YOU'RE OBJECTIFYING WOMEN"

*proceeds to laugh when she sees other people getting hurt*I would by lying though if I said it had nothing to do with how she looks. In fact, it works because of it. The more disney and animated like you are capable of making yourself look (especially the expressions), the more it's going to attract people because it's just aesthetically pleasing. There is a reason animated character often look like that and why we can't help wanting to watch it over and over again or we feels we can't look away.“All filipinos can sing”
Me, a filipino, who can’t sing: 👁👄👁I feel cool for not having tiktok tbhit’s true, nowadays talent doesn’t really matter what does matter is whether your are hot or notShe gets millions of views by literally just bopping her head and making weird faces. Go girl give us nothing! ❤️She served in the US Navy???!!! That is literally the most badass thing ever!Loved this format of how they react. It feels they like reacting/talking at the same time 👍She looks really young and pretty, thats why people followed her like hungry packs of wolves, mystery solved lolThe 17 year old who looks like a 13 year old who thinks like a 28 year old on the bottom right speaks the truth.i love this style of video compared to some of the other videos. it was much more like a conversation and loved seeing their reactions to each other’s reactions lolJax is so honest ,especially about the “hot “ situation .As a “young person” I’m THANKFUL that the older generation gives us their OPINIONS. Does that mean we have to do what they think/say? No! But that does mean we can learn from them. If you don’t know your history, you’re doomed to repeat the past98% of filipino's:can sing







2%of filipino's: ARE PROUD TO BE FILIPINO'S.

Im very very proud to be filipino!!Jaxon is that friend who is funny af when he's honestJaxon isn’t simping. Just because he says a person is attractive doesn’t mean anything. Stop misusing the termI love that Jaxon has no filter, and just says whatever the hell he wants. King shitI feel like anyone can get famous on Tiktok now, regardless of what you do.It's simple cause she looks like some bubbly Disney Princess and the way she does her expressions and the way she bops her head is addicting and makes us see that again and again,don't you think it's kinda satisfying...It isn't her fault that she became popular 
𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗸 𝘁𝗼𝗸 𝗴𝗶𝗿𝗹𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝗵𝗲𝗿. 
Also she is popular cause she looks animatedSo the bottom left chick can say the tik tok girl is cute, but Jax can't say she's hot?....what happened to equality? Good job Jax for standing your ground to toxic-femininity.What Jaxon said is true, many women complain about several women being famous in tik tok because of their bodies, but most of those who use tik tok are girls so you always see several videos of dubious quality of beautiful boys in the main tab , and believe me, this is something that happens all over the world, I already checked the brazilian tik tok and the same thing happens, many boys from the main tab are more there for the beauty than for the quality of their videosJaxon saying "she's hot"... 
I still remember when he was still in Kids React... wow... time flies so quickly...It's funny how Bella was in the military but now she's a Tiktok sensation hahaI like the fact that theres some sort of communication between the reactors and not just us watching each reactor talk basically to themselvesI've been following this channel since I was in school and rn I'm a doctoral student. In all these years, THIS has been the single most crisp and precise video with nothing but facts facts facts. Also, these 3 are pretty smart kids, NGL. Good job, FBE!🔥🔥🔥You know one day I think Bella will surpass Charli .This man Jaxon just embraced being a male teenager in the introWhy isn’t she known for her singing like cmon Tik Tok she’s a really good singer."shes literally doing what everyone else is doing on tiktok" that's exactly the point lol"Bella served in the US navy and she has been BLOWING UP.." i see what you did thereI loved the video concept with the squares 👌🏼 its nice to see their reactions at the same time and also see them interact with each other... nice one FBE 😁👍🏼I honestly think that she's popular bc she's pretty. Sure the tiktoks are ig a little cute, but lets say if someone unattractive like me had done it, I wouldnt get as much attention and traction to the videos.I like how she’s famous for having no talent but I’ve seen people who are hilarious and talented and don’t get the same recognitionI love how honest Jaxson is 😂I just love how honest and respectful they are in giving their opinions.I love Jaxon because he always has an honest opinion.She's a vibe. Not sure which one, or why, but she is."I don't know why she popped off." Because she's pretty. It's not that hard to figure out.If I’m being honest, all she does is nod her head—
And honestly, I kinda think her followers are made up of simps and bots.
If anyone else nodded their head and posted it, they would not get as many followers as Bella Poarch as Bella is just really pretty.
And to be famous you just need to have a really pretty face which Bella has.I love how we can go from making a girl who moves her head famous to bashing a girl for getting a tattoo that symbolizes colonialism. It's like our generation is bucket headed and "woke" at the same time. 🥴"All Filipinos could sing"
Im filipino and my voice sounds like a dying chicken👁👄👁People really underestimate the power of the toddler audienceI just love Bella. She's real. No pretensions. And so humbleThe girl said “I am just glad she isn’t a white girl” then said “stop objectifying women” whattttt“She has this cottage core aesthetic to her face.” 
I don’t know if I’ve heard a sentence that has made me want to slam my face against a wall more.My boy Jaxon keeping it too real. MadladNo one slay facial expressions as good as BellaI really don't think she deserves the hate...she makes videos that make her happy...it's not her fault that her videos are going viral..why hate her for doing something she likes and posting it no matter how much effort she put into it..let her live...it's the tiktok app users liking her videos and watching them...she's also really talented..I don't know why a lot of people hated her. She's fine to me. She can sing she has talent.People say that “she doesn’t deserve the fame or the clout” but she didn’t ask for it. It just came on it’s own. Unless she sold her soul. That’s a different storyJax understands how the real world works. The others are naive.Honestly, she's just really so cute 😭😭😭"All filipinos can sing."

Me: Wait. So I'm not a filipino?I dont watch tiktoks but that simple movement is such a vibe, its satisfying and entertaining to watch. I dont know if its weird but yeah,  its just my opinion.I don't care to the other people's opinion but I really love her videos and find her very unique to the other's that makes my mood better everytime I watch Bella Porch videos on tiktok🙂🙂🙂When she said all filipinos can sing
I feel like i'm adopted cause i don't know how to sing 😂😂😂Oh wow. She can move her head. That's great talent. Somebody make her famous wow!I really like this set of teens
The asian guy was always on point when he speaks
The girl with braids is so cool and is a vibe, always chill
The girl on lower left is a typical fun to be with, really says what she mean and got birght smile always 
While Jaxon is legendary for being direct on what he says and really funnyI DEFFFFFFFF LOVE her cartoon face. She looks just like a manga. Love it so muchJaxon is the only reason I'm still subscribed 💁I understand the concern of the girl who made the comment about how “white girls don’t deserve fame” and instead people of color do, but what happened to talent? Like who cares about their color or background, what type of entertainment do they offer to the audience? How funny are they? What type of talents do they offer? Are they a good person? Your appearance shouldn’t be the deciding factor on whether or not you get famous.i love jaxon just spitting straight factsWhen I was little I used to watch FBE and I thought the kids there was so damn smart just because they had a really big vocabulary to describe the thing they are watching or doing, now I’m 13 and now I can understand what they are actually talking about, time flies fastSo basically the reason she is so famous is because of the algorithms on tiktok so the first algorithm is the one that helps all videos have a chance of blowing up. The second algorithm is the beauty algorithm this is an AI the recognises if a person fits the definition of beauty since the app was originally Chinese the AI is programmed with the Chinese standard of beauty which is basically what bella looks like. If the AI recognises you as fitting the standard of beauty it gives you a better chance of blowing upThe issue that came out of Bella's tattoo was a big spark between the Korean and Filipino community and you gotta dig into the issue of both sides to understand it. Then look at how Bella reacted in the situation. I kinda find Bella cute but that's that.I mean..... Jaxon has a pointIm a women, and Im so done with people saying Jax is rude, there are worse people out there.Jaxon is so honest. I really like that.She got famous because she was getting so much hate for no reason and people wanted to support her. She deserves all the support in the world! 😊How can Jax say something so controversial...yet so brave?“Keep your personal life personal, and your social life social, because if you get those mixed up, you’ll spiral out of control!” 
- Braid hair girlDamn. Overflowing with talent. Wonder where I can practice those head bops, must've taken years to perfectThis is what counts as entertainment these days, a woman bobbing her head to music...

We need to delete everything.Her tattoe is not a rising sun, it is a heart with rays! And people ASSUMED THAT IT WAS A RISING SUN. I don't get why people hated her for being famous, it is not her fault that she was hype for doing head shakes, for being pretty, for having a good voice, and for being kind and patient towards ther haters.Jaxon stating facts throughout this whole video3:17 "all filipinos can sing"

Me a filipino: SANA ALL 🙁All of the teens should do among us or a speed run of any gameShe now has over 40 million followers. I had never heard or seen her before this video and of course I now follower her on tiktokShe became famous bc someone duetted her and was a bit mean. Then all the big tiktokkers were nice and sweet to her and did that with head thing with her and that’s why she got she hype :). Sorry I’m not good at EnglishAs I stated I am Gen X...honestly as long as something does not personally have negative affects on my well being, my relationships, or my life I don't care what people do. Let people be themselves...as long as you are not negatively (I don't mean you are offended either REALLY AFFECTS YOUR LIFE) affected leave people alone to live their lives the way they see fit...it's none of your business otherwise...SO BACK OFF KARENShe’s got a point about school, if they actually made the effort to become educated early on in their careers, they could’ve avoided a lot of mistakes bc they’d have a lot more knowledge on certain thingsTime flies so fast, I could still remember how Jaxon reacts to age of ultron and now on these tiktok trends.You could literally bop your head and get famous now. The world is a circusGirls: Stop objectifying women!
two seconds earlier
Girls: I'm glad it's not a white girl.

Me: .........  I miss the Spice Girls.TikTok stars are overrated as hellOMG I LOVED the four of then together so entertaining. And ofcourse jaxon is always always a vibe haha. More of these 💜💜Bruh... I gotta agree to all of them... they all made a point👏I don't blame her for anything 
PEOPLE made her famous
How is it her fault?I just known this girl because of the issue of her tattoo and I'm so surprised that they didn't mention how filipinos literally started an online war against korea just  because of her, and i guess some korean content creator is scared of how powerful Filipinos in social media so they apologized for what some korean people did"All Filipinos can sing."
My friends:  *voice cracking veerytime they sing*Love the channel!! Keep of the amazing work :)She’s a vibe. Nailed itPERIOD all filipinos can sing ✨😂I love Jaica and Jax for being honest with their reacts.Jaxon is a fucking king and a chadJaxon is an absolute moodNot all Filipinos can sing...we just sing anywaysJaxon speaking facts and those girl weren’t ready for them😂Bella: nodding her head lip syncing m to the b and gets (40m likes)

They were among my favorite series.Honestly, I'd rather have people watch a harmless TikTok like hers as opposed to something like those weird hypersexual POV TikToksHer charisma tho it's just high amazing5:52 this girl gets it. Everyone's always looking for some shit to be offended by and it's stupid as stupid getsShe served in the Navy? How old is she?! She looks so young!Jax is so honest...I love itI’m sorry. But I’m not even Korean and I still found that tattoo offensive, however I love how she apologized and took accountability cause like cancel culture is SOOO freaking frustrating. BUT BUT BUT no one should be rolling their eyes at it or saying we shouldn’t care about it cause that’s not solving the problem.Jax needs to start a podcastThe song ""Build A B****" was literally made for Jaxon 🤣No offense but I miss the old teen react crew."All Filipinos can sing"
That's truejaxon's just an honest teenage boy hahaShe’s not half. She’s full Filipino🇵🇭When I see namjoon,Jin and yoongi bopping to that beat I literally ScReAmeD they look so cute and funny😂😂She’s so cute and she has a very chill vibei hate tiktok....but imma do the wap danceNot even 10 seconds in and I'm done. Jaxon can't speak without getting yelled at anymore.  It's amazing tho. He should stay like that.
Jax is the example of the next line in intellectual who gets yelled at for no reason.I really like Bella idk why ppl are getting so mad about a woman having fun on the internet :( she does definitely not deserve all that hate she has and still get- she’s such a amazing human being seriouslyHonestly, I think she’s got a huge following cause she looks like a cartoon character.3:55 lol so he can’t say she’s hot and that’s the reason why he cares, but she can say the reason she cares is her race? Aight imma head outLove how these teen reactors are not judgemental.Jaxon getting straight to the hard factsthe maturity/wisdom ramp is steep. the difference between teenage maturity and mid-twenties maturity is huge. the difference between 25 and 35 is massive.We need more people like Jax."All Filipinos can sing"

Me:😶🤦Bruh Jax is so right like idk how on other vids girls call Harry Styles hot and everything but once he says it it’s objectifying woman it’s so dumbShe has charisma that is why and more than just a pretty face she is also talented. Btw, Bella Poarch is indeed pure filipina by ethnicity she just became american when she moved to Usa when she was 13 yrs. old. She is actually fluent in tagalog. But since she is already living abroad she can be considered american.Neither minority nor majority should get it. Talented people should get itIt's so strange seeing Jaxon in an old kids react video and now as a teenager 😭I think instead of Sobbing your Head...she should open a singing channel I mean she has a good voice  or an actual talent.....I would love that too.She looks young as hell, but was in the US military.Jaxon the alpha, speaking out truth3:52 there’s hope for this lad if I was this boy father I’d be so proud lolHand down to these two amazing women! They're smart and honest!  Wow 👏👏👏"All Filipinos can sing." Y e sWish I could have conversations with friends like this 🥺We can't hate over Bella she's nice ❤️ 🇵🇭"All Filipinos can sing" periodt😏For me i think haters hate someone because they didn't have what that person achieved. They think "i hate this Bella Poarch girl" but inside "damn why she can do this,do that with just her face". So haters, just be yourself. Instead of hating them, why don't you just make it as your motivation to be more successful in life. Peace ✌🏼😁"Stop objectify woman!" Said the girl that she was happy about the fact that the girl on tiktoc was not white. Kids these days.I mean college isn't for everyone. I would say if you're a social media person who doesn't want to go to school then find something other than social media to support you. A side gig is all. Other than that, social media careers pay a lot for big time people.Never seen one of these become a debate about gender, race, and everyone being hypocritical until it came down to the teens being from Gen Z and it's so embarrassing to be a part of. LmaoJaxon is definitely a man of cultureI miss the old teens😭 they're all adults now... Come back 😭I like her....her expressions are funny..Fact: after the tattoo, some Koreans started to call the Filipino people poor, uneducated, and etc. Which sparked #cancelkorea in the philippines. And Bella Poarch gives me Belle Delphine vibesshe got famous cause she looks and her actions are like animated"every filipino can sing"
Me: can't sing
Also me: *crys in tagalog3:16 most of the Filipinos can sing but not all of us can do it 😅 Well Imma say many of us is talented when it comes to music. And btw i didn't knew she was a Filipina and she's that famous which is pretty awesome 👍😊4:15 PROVE HIM WRONG I DARE YOU. That's how everything works. If you're considered pretty, you become popular. If you're not considered pretty, you're just "average".jaxon is basically me when all of my friends have been talking about herI thought half of the reason that Bella was famous beside the fact that she was pretty was because she was a war veteran.Bella Poarch lowkey looks like Belle DelphineCharli must be shook Bella got the same amount of likes in an hour then charli gets in a week 💀I like how the girl with braids did her makeup. I've never seen anyone make their lower lashes white before.Am I the only one that thinks Bella looks like Vanellope from Wreck-it-Ralph!?!?Love how it’s more of a roasting video than a reaction video"all filipinos can sing"

Me,a filipino who is not good at singing: *I dont know if im considered as filipino...*Hey !!!!!!!!!!   You guys should react to "Mad At Disney" by Salem Ilese.  or "Mad At Disney but it's a duet with a male perspective" FT. Cameron Sanderson.   Such good vocals.  <315 year old here. My god my iq dropped by at least 50 points by what these girls were sayingthought the girl bouncing her head was the dumbest tiktok Ive ever seen and then I saw 4:11I feel bad for jaxon as a fellow prepubescent boy we can’t crush on women without being called disrespectful, we’re hormonal of course we’re going to be looking at her in a way most women won’t.As far as i know Tiktok is not a competition app. It's not her fault being famous. It's the people's choice! It's not her fault that her video blew up. It's our choice. If some of y'all can't bop with her them don't! Not just because you can't vibe with her means others can't, not just because u think (all she know is bopping her head) then u should've done that first!I'm not even on tiktok but i see bella everywherePERIOD. ALL FILIPINOS CAN SING
ME: Mom, am i really a Filipino??Bella is receiving hate because she's beautiful, as in insanely cute and gorgeous. People take that hate and find excuses to let her have it. It's petty af. ..but all that girls seems to want to do, is spread some fun and love. I do hope the many people who love and very actively support her can make up for the hate.Its because her facials are cartoony! It's not just head bops3:57 sweetie I don’t think you know what it means to objectify someone.She looks like glitch from Wreck it Ralph. like not even just physically, but like her facial actions and everything.Jax is so frickin honestLol Jaxon is so honest and I love thatHer tattoe is not a rising sun, it is a heart with rays! And people ASSUMED THAT IT WAS A RISING SUN. I don't get why people hated her for being famous, it is not her fault that she was hype for doing head shakes, for being pretty, for having a good voice, and for being kind and patient towards ther haters.It's fitting. Ryu with the best start of the season for the Jays to clinch a playoff spot!!! Congrats 2020 Blue Jays!!!Yankees fan here, I just wanted to say congratulations to the Blue Jays on clinching a postseason berth, good luck you guys.Ryu is so underrated. But congratulations for the blue jays  for clinching a play off spot since 2016!WEVE FINALLY DONE IT. Congrats to the entire Blue Jays team for pushing on through such a different season and playing as good as you have. We couldnt be more proud for the playoffs to return to this team. Best of luck to all other playoff bound teams.If the Jays manage to win at least 1 game in the playoffs, than Bo Bichette, Cavan Biggio and Vlad Guerrero Jr will have more playoff wins than Mike Trout.Ryu. So dominant todayCongrats for Canada's team for going from 0.414 to playoffs in a year.I miss Ryu in Dodger blue. Jays looking good.Ryu's pitching was perfect. As a Korean, I'm so proud to see him throw well in every game.Aside from my home team (Dodgers), the Blue Jays have been my favorite team of the season, by far. Really enjoyed watching them. Tough road ahead for them in the AL playoffs, but you never know. They could spring a surprise or two.Awwww yeah! The Jays have clinched their ticket to the postseason! It's been great seeing this young core develop...their best is yet to come!Congrats Toronto on the win. Good luck in the playoffsThis Jays team has what it takes to make a stir in the playoffs!  Lets go Jays.I think Vladdy's finally starting to read MLB pitching the way he read minor league pitching. When he's hot he can be one of the best hitters in baseball. I think he could be on the cusp of truly braking out at the MLB level. Fingers crossedRyu. What a stud.Blue Jays soaring high to the playoffs mountain. Let's Go Blue Jays. I love my baseball team. 💙Congrats Blue Jays!If Ryu can pitch like he did today, the Jays could be a very tough out in the playoffs. Would love to see him face his former team, the Dodgers, in the WS.Vlady really needs to work on that launch angle this offseason. If so, he will finally be able to get balls out of the infield and over the fence to the elite level we expect him to be. Will be a serious MVP talent if it works out.Feel good team. Vladimir is warming upThat's the difference between 60 and 160 games ...60 games makes baseball more emotional...😁😁A los playoffs Azulejos! Excelente! 😎LETS! GO! JAYS! Playoffs here we come!!!Anything can happen in a 3 game series he played tight games vs the rays should be a great series even if we come up shortlets go jays you made it lets upset teams in playoffsVladdy is hitting everything right now.. every time he comes to the plate it feels like hes gonna do some damageHI~! I am a big fan of Hyunjin Ryu and Hanhwa Eagles. Ryu had carried the Eagles for many years. He doesn't blame his team even if his tim makes errors. He always concentrates on his pitches. That's why he is the best pitcher in Korea and he show nice pitches in American League. Plz dominate the MLB Ryu!Let’s go Blue Jays!!Man vlad has really trimmed down since game 1. Looks like he lost 20-25lbs. But i guess when you're in a lockdown back home for 3 months then playing ball everyday, its prob gonna happen. He looks good!Go jays go. Let's beat the rays. Been waiting since 2016."Improved leaps and bounds as a defensive player." Made me laugh.The Jays made a Wild Card spot? That's quite impressive for a young team!
Good luck against... Oh, The Tampa Bay Rays.Now I can see the difference between Ryu and other pitchers.  Ryu uses his fastball to bait batters, and throw 4 different off speed pitches to all corners of strike zone.   The batters don't really get easy pitches.  I even feel the batters hitting  Ryu's pitches are being lucky.  Much better than throwing 96-97 miles fastballs trying to overpower the batters and get back to back home runs.Sanchez made my heart stop for a sec in the 8thBlue Jays killn it and they havent even played at homeRyu can do it!Congrats jays, and to the looks of things Rays and jays gonna have their first postseason meetingJays make postseason! Pitching needs some work, and defensively need to improve but looking better with Bo and Cavan in the middle. Bats are coming with multiple hits, and hope Vladdy will start hitting with power. Should be interesting.Lets Go Jays!!!!Caleb Joseph was the happiest after the game because it's the only time he gets to step on the fieldHi think Ryu will be starting in game 1 of round 1. Good news! Especially considering you only need 2 wins to advance to round 2Go Jays!Poor Gary Sanchez he swings the bat hard and it is always a out.That play where Gary Sanchez almost got a grand slam,I would be shocked still the next day if he got a grand slam from the guy that does nothing.Let s go Blue Jays, Clinched poseatson☺☺☺😊😊😊The title should've given credit to Ryu's 7 scoreless innings instead of Guerrero Jr. I understand that the Dominican dude is somehow more popular but Ryu deserves the spotlight here.Sad they won’t be able to play in front of a packed Roger’s Stadium in the playoffsLet s go Vladito.Jam it. I’m a Yankees fangood luck jays !Gleyber Torres has completely lost his power and his defense is atrociousOur Ace!!!!I blame all Blue Jays' failures on Bill Caudill's contract.I’m a Astros fan I’m happy that we get to see the gurriel brothers in the playoffsWEVE MADE IT IN!Wonder where Marcus Stroman is at... oh that’s right he’s as home and his Met’s aren’t gonna make playoffs either. Jokes on him 😂ryu carried this teamHey Yankees try not to choke in the playoffs like u always doway to go 6.Yes blue jays to play offs :) well done... u going be playing against...Buffalo has seen more playoff games than like troutMe when the Yankees lose: .-.LET'S GOJudges strike zone is so tallCon ese palo se parecio mucho al bladi el real bladiHey Ryu! Come to NY! Anyway! CongratulationsAnybody know when the playoff merch is gonna go on sale?ryu is not japanese not chinese 
He is Koreanlets win it all"We hope to get him hot."Jay's will make some noise..Were the better team nowYankees no serious to play.Ryu for mvpThis Yankees just can't win on the road.They will exist in 1st round.who are they taking on wild cardLike: Bluejays win the World Series 
Comment: Bluejays win the World SeriesHaora es q se separan los hombres d lo muchacho bamo bladiRyu wasting his talent at Blue jaysgogo  ryu  torontorye aceDodgers Fan HereAh ryu go..d?Why are half the players overweight and out of shape?Blue jays will be eliminated in wildcard150th commentFirstWDon’t attend chemistry and your whole life will become a magic showKids these days asking "if" it works, not "why" it worksThis is the kind of guy who never passed high school chemistry class.This is the reason submarines can stay that long under water without running out of air. This process is called electrolysis, where water separates into hydrogen and oxygenEducated people: Science.

Tik Tockers: Trick.When you electrify saltwater it makes chlorine gas (bad stuff) I learned this from how we make oxygen in submarines.I’d be afraid of the battery blowing up in my face (FINAL DESTINATION style).Guy: turns off tv with a remote

Him: hmm does that actually workWait till all these TikTok “creators”  find out the sun doesn’t really disappear at night.You don't actually need the dish soap , only the water and salt , and everyone with some education should know this trick , because it is used to separate oxygen and hydrogen from water .“Does that actually work?” Battery explodesThis is a huge milestone in our path to videos of: “Okay guys, there’s this myth going around that if you add up all the angles in a triangle, you get 180°. Today, we’re gonna test it out ourselves and finally put this myth to bed!”Just basic chemistrySad that the dude concurs that it “actually works”, and goes no deeper to understand what he sees."Does that actually work?"

Last words before deathI feel like this guy will try just about anything... He microwaved tinfoilIt’s breaking down the water “h2o” and separating them via positive and negative ports on the battery, 1oxygen the for every 2 Hydrogen, it’s how you get a car to run off of water, the motor runs off of hydrogen when it is separated.I bet you Young people dont know this one : just put two different Metals in a lemon and connect the metals to a LED"Breaking news: Tiktokers are starting to discover science and calling it a magic or a trick"


Editors note: This is the best comment section I read
Thanks for you guys it made me laughIf you feel like you don't work hard enough, just remember this man's braincells existomg this adds so much value to my life!Don't use table salt for this, it still makes hydrogen and oxygen, but also produces chlorine gas (toxic). Use baking soda instead, then it's Hydrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxideInstead of being someone who slept on his science classes in primary grade, isn't it better if you put the effort to learn why does it happens and then explain it to the viewers.That's what happens when you bunk chemistry class"this is what happens if you stick a fork in wall socket"
"does that actually work"
diesI feel proud to know that I knew already that this was electrolysisIt's cool the guitar player from Soundgarden is getting back out there.He’s the kinda guy who’s mind is blown when the toaster toasts the bread.1. You don’t need the soap. It just makes the bubbles more noticeable.
2. You are essentially shorting out the battery, and as it is likely and alkaline one, you are running the risk of it exploding, and as that is oxygen and hydrogen bubbling off the battery terminal, you potentially have a fire risk.RC enthusiasts been doing this for years to discharge batteries for disposalIt's called electrolysis. You don't need dish soap, and salt just makes the electricity pass through water to the other electrode betterNxt wks episode : Flicking a light switch on & off.I swear "dOeS tHaT aCtUaLlY wOrK" is gonna be one of these kids last words someday.Imagine if people actually used their time to learn a trade or new skillWhen you don't pay attention in science class, every day is a miracle.."You need a little bit of dish soap here"
_Two shots of vodka_I definitely needed to know thisTikTokers acting like they discovered electrolysisMy dude just learned basic physics with a pinch of chemistry. Just don’t be holding any flames 🔥 nearby 😂He is a type of guy who would bring 19 friends to watch a movie cause the movie says 18+Kind of guy thats suprised to find out there is light in the fridge when you open itDON‘T DO THIS IN A BADLY VENTILATED ROOM OR DON‘T DO IT AT ALL. CHLORINE GAS IS ALSO PRODUCED BECAUSE OF THE CHLORIDE IONS SUPPLIED BY THE SALT!!!I swear. The laymen are impressed by anything.The dawn and the salt are the catalyst, the reaction is the separation of the hydrogen and oxygen.  The resulting gas is called Brown's Gas because it's not pure hydrogen but rather two-parts hydrogen and one-part oxygen.  Google hydrogen generators online.   You can install them in cars for increased fuel efficiency.This is the same concept as Chrome plating and Hydrogen fuel cells. The gas is Hydrogen and Oxygen and is commonly known as Brown gas. When harvested correctly, it can be used to cut steel without making it hot. Freshly cut steel with an open flame that is cool to the touch. The gas converts back into water after combustion, saturating the item being cut. Unfortunately it takes roughly the same energy to create it as you get from it... First law of Thermodynamics.This is what happen when you skip chemistry classCongratulations Tiktokers, y'all have discovered Chemistry.Wow you've reinvented electrolyse, holy shit!!!!!! Wished i would've had a camera 40 years ago.My science teacher should be fired immediatelyIt is like seeing proof of murder and saying"is that actually real?"And this is the fuel to make a car run without gasolineWhen a caveman discovers chemistry:This fascination occurs when you dont study applications for basic chemistry“Let’s end the video the second it happens”How to cause a explosion 101:“You won’t believe”

Actually yea, I would’ve believed it.This is the kind of guy who would shove a fork into an electrical socket because he saw it on tik tokHe is making highly explosive hydrogen gass rn and just filling his house with itI’ll be honest, I never knew this trick existed and didn’t know the logic behind it. I’m a senior-to-be in school and taking chemistry next year, since I took anatomy my junior year. Not everyone knows abt this; let people learn, and stop batting them down.So that's why my phone battery be dying quickly, it be smokingAnyone thats surprised by this obviously didn't do high-school chemistry lmaoWhy do we tell actors to “break a leg?”

Because every play has a cast.Haha yes! Making literal chlorine gasTik Toker finds out about electrolysis which is taught to middle schools kidsTikTokers are evolving so much. They’re figuring out chemistry!People that skipped school or did not pay attention in chemistry class will be amazedPretty sure everybody saw the science teacher do this in like 3rd grade 🤣That “little bit of dish soap” is giving me “two shots of vodka” vibesI sure hope these kids will know how to fill out an application for a job one day and stay out of prisonOh boy, the day he figures out what electromagnetism is he’s gonna have a a panic attack.

Edit : FYI electromagnetism is a different term of physics learn science people, This term is unrelated to the actual video and plus I said the day he figures out WHAT not when he figured out what electrolysis is ya need glasses kiddos?When people miss secondary school chemistry this happens (this process is called electrolysis)Now set light to the gasses and really blow your mind. 🙃Reading this comment section realizing public education has failed us the point were people dont even know what electrolysis isMy life is now complete 😂😂Finally someone that doesn't say ,"wait for part 2". THANK YOUI can’t believe everyone here assumes that everyone here will know about science some people are kids obviously they don’t know about it but if they learn they can start being more interested in scienceYou dont actually need the dish soap. Just salt. This is how you safely deactivate old Lipo batteries.

Cut power lead off (different lengths to avoid a short) 
Drop in a bucket of salty water.
When the water has turned blue and the lipo is no longer "fizzing" it is safe to recycle or throw in the garbageIt’s called lithiumCould be dangerous. Chlorine gas is formed during the electrolytic reaction between water and NaCl.Amonium chloride much better, especially for etching..👍👍If only he paid attention in electrolysis chapterLast time I checked, this was called scienceYeah also put the tip of your tonque on one of the teminals Let me know how that works too. Put that on video!So, this is how to recharge
your batteries.*this guy* : sees his father pulling out in time.

Let's see guys if this actually works or not.He’s the kinda guy who swallows toothpasteGood way to make chlorine gasThat’s why water with minerals like salt have E.Cs  ( electrical conductivity). We used this growing cannabis we can tell if the plant is eating or not eating depending on if the ec went up or downYes. You literally do it in high school science except with metal rods attached to a batteryThat’s how a saltwater pool works salt makes chlorine to keep your pool clean"Morton" Salt? If this dude's using it, just take the T out if it.So it’s safe to say everyone in the comments passed chemistrySomeone didn't pay attention to science class. But after allocating his full attention to this video, wondering "how does this work?"i knew as soon as I saw that guy that people would be saying “he’s the type of guy that-“Good to know when I run out of soda and want something bubblyThis is how they control the weather.Let’s put in a little dish soap, proceeds to add the height of Mount EverestHave they just told us the new cleaning solution1st guy: little salt
2nd guy: whole bottle of saltIts called hydro electrolysis. Its the process of ripping the hydrogen and oxygen apart into their individual components in the water. In high school I used to make a fuel cell out of a coffee can to collect the hydrogen in water bottles to be thrown in a fire lolWas the 'fizzle' worth the cost of the battery?You can actually get the same results as well as avoiding spending money on salt by throwing the batteries to the sea 👍have a nice day lads👌Electrolysis , H2 and O2 gasAnother genius in the makingImagine how much panic he feels when he sees that fire can be put on oilTommy Chong be getting too high sometimesThat’s how I discharge lipo battery’s, and you don’t need the washing up liquid eitherHe's the kind of guy who'll make sure to wake you up just to remind you its already bedtime.what did you achieve today? 🔋 👀"Does it really work, or how I learned to make chlorine gas"Here before the 'he is the type of guy' commentsAhh that’s why you get that funny sensation when you put your tongue on the hexagon terminal🤣When your tryna poison someone 🤣"I'm worried that the Youtube is slowly turning into a degenerate tiktok cringe, please spread the word“Ah ha!  I was wondering how to separate H2O. I searched google and nothing. Guess I didn't look hard enough.

How do you do this on a larger scale?Basic hydrolysis"A little bit" of dish soap *proceeds to put in enough for 1000 plates*I wonder if it works with other kinds of batteriesYes it makes pure oxygen and hydrogen gasThat's a basic chemistry if you have studied anything in a class😑🤦🏻‍♀️For safety, it can be dangerousThe salt produces chlorine gas. Use sodium hydroxide to produce hydrogen and oxygen.Cam: "We gotta put in a little bit of dish soap." 
Also Cam: *Pours half the bottle into the cup*If bubbles form on top of the water use a lighter to pop the bubbles and they pop Loud.I’m gonna try this out soon 😮😮Tbh i didn’t know this probably cause my school doesn’t teach us shit like this but still quite interestingTiktokers have started to understand chemistry
I mean, the basic part of itBest and cheapest way to recharge you batteries.*sees something that has been proven to work*
*tries it out*
*it works*
"NO WAY"How tf do you spill Salt💀💀I too like producing (toxic/lethal) chlorine gas. Sometimes I like to make my batteries explode by throwing them into water to.He’s the type of person that applauded when the airplane lands.Now light it up.What a coincidence.   My kids and I actually did something like this today to produce hydrogen...which we ignited with a lighter.Me: I think there's a 9volt battery in my Smoke detector! Let's use that. 🔥😃Wow electrolysis works?!?Y’all never do this with chlorinated water it’ll make chlorine gas as well and that’s mega poisonousLiterally everybody in the comments that knows basic chemistry: 🤓Its called chemistryWow, you discovered physics, cool.This really isn't that unbelievable or much of "trick" for that matter, its just basic  chemistry. Something you learn in high school. That is if you were paying attention.  Im pretty sure its just a simple way of creating hydrogen gas. I'll prob get slammed if im wrong here but I must move on to the next video. 😉They taught us this Witch craft magic in chemistry classThat is because salt increases conductivityPeople who actually learned something in school: Yeah of course it will work...
Popular kids from school: NO WAY🤯🤯This app has officially dumbed down grown men so bad that are actually excited to see water fizelHow to get rid of lipo battery already.Schools and professors now crying in a corner knowing people at that age are just realising stuff they SHOULD have learnt in grade 6 !Salt make the water more conductiveWell now you got an homemade Alka-Seltzer.Funfact: you're reading this funfactIf I were him I'd be concerned what the reaction was doing. Source (watches too many science/chemistry videos).Okay at this point everyone is just slandering this man for learning lmfao, just let the man beTried this at home last night.I’m in the hospital now in the ward.I’ll be under observation for a few days.Please dont try this at home.Wish me luck.I love generating chlorine gas in my home“Does that actually work?”

*Battery explodes*Basic chemistry hereTeachers would rather teach us about politics then 1+1.The side with all the bubbles is hydrogen. The side with less is oxygen.Now take a lighter to the bubbles and you create a hydrogen gasPrison guards hate this trickYeah. There is this amazing thing called science!!Yeah it’s called hydrogen. Congratulations, you built a hydrogen fuel cell generator.Covalent bonds...I literally know this grandpa, I used to be friends with him like 3 years ago but I decided to uninstall tik tok, it's amazing of how he improved this much and got this famousWoah! It’s electrolysis lmaoAdd a little sulfuric acidscience teacher: let's do a fun trick
students: 😒
tic tok: let's do a fun trick
viewers: 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯OK, now hold a lit match over the glass.Welcome, you've made hydrogen and oxygenFIRST U AWESOMEYeah just don't let anything spark near it, exploding water is the hintThis is not a trick...this is electrolysis.And he doesn't even realize that he's electrolysis rust removing or electroplatingHes probably the guy that watches a video of someone putting gas into a car and start driving. 
He would be like "hmm? i wonder if that actually works?Hey kids, don't play with batteries, no matter how many dumb Tiktoks you see. Thank you.Wow. Now you can waste a perfectly good battery and everyone's time. Dude's gettin paid for this😂*Watches video of elementary school science experiment*
Full grown child: WOAH DOES THAT ACTUALLY WORK!?!?All the salt does is make the water extremely conductive and the soap makes it so you can see the battery discharging fast as it can. Battery will be dead in 45 seconds. WowMan, I never knew batteries can do magic like that! 😮 I thought the only just function devices.Obviously it will work cause salt water is a good conductor of electricity dudeCongrats you just discovered electrolytesDude gets so amazed by simple process typically learned in 9th grade science lab project. That's good though at least he has interestI'm pretty sure thats Clorine gas; not Oxygen.Can any of you brainiacs explain how this video gets 12 million views in 3 days.  That’s got to be a bigger mystery than bubbles off an electrodeDude that's just simple electrolysis...This gas which comes is clorine and its very dangerous. So pay attention while doing this.Someone skipped science in junior schoolWow this is class 5 science:
This is called electrolysis and it would do even without detergent .
U just need pure salt solution called brine.It's worked on principle of electrolysisThis shit is actually called electrolysisHes the type of guy to ask for a refund after eating a bad mealEat a lot of beans and you can recreate this in the bath without a batteryAcontece que está a aquecer a água ,o sódio do sal é um bom condutor liga dois fios na tomada bota as duas pontas num balde plástico com água e sal,e pronto aí está água quenteIt's ok with the old guy as he is remembering his old school..But wbt young guy he literally studied it like few years ago and it's simpleAll these chemistry experts on here but somehow you ended up with a career at best buy🤷🏾‍♂️I swear "dOeS tHaT aCtUaLlY wOrK" is gonna be one of these kids last words someday.When you don't pay attention in science class, every day is a miracle..This is the reason submarines can stay that long under water without running out of air. This process is called electrolysis, where water separates into hydrogen and oxygenI still can't believe I got the PS5 EARLY - I hope you enjoy the video! 😍
More next-gen (PS5 + Xbox Series X) videos coming soon! 👍Petition for ali-A to bring back his old introAliA - "I'm not sure if I'm allowed to show you that light being turned on"

Also AliA - *turns it on again*not gonna lie that textured surface looks cool but seems like it will be a nightmare to keep clean if it attracts dust like my ps4, which is quite literally a dust magnetThe console is definitely big. But I love that futuristic design. The digital edition PS5 looks like the best next-gen console out of everything from Sony or Microsoft.tbh i think its managable but i dont think ill be able to fit it in to the small space my ps4s in (ps im buying it soon😆)I can't wait to see what the scuff gaming controller is going to look, feel and perform like!? I am so freaking excited!!!Its considerably bigger then I expected. I personally wont be getting any new gen consoles untill atleast 2022, have a few things left to square away with my house etc first. But seeing as how I've been playstation for so long I'm probably going to stick with it and get the ps5 when the time comesI remember watching Ali opening PS4 nearly 7 years ago, my oh my time flew so quicklyThe console looks beautiful and very futuristicI'm LIVING for the small details all over the case.
They took the term 'Attention to detail' to a whole new level..Consoles in 2020: there a little bigger than the last generation.         Consoles in 3000: so we just got the console under my house so we're ready to play825 GB
Call of Duty: "I'll be taking that"Will it have the YLOD or some other version of yellow light of death or Red Ring of death or some other type of problem with the hardware due to poor design or cooling? I bet when the PS2 came out they made a big deal of it being totally awesome and immersive experience like never before.I’m so glad you did an unboxing so the PlayStation gang can anticipate what we’re getting. Also your awesome 😎 👏Who's ready for PS5 release soon!!!! 
Let's gooo!Not going to lie, both these consoles have their stereotypes in aesthetics, but they both look like they are from the next generation. So COOL!Love the ps5 overall including the design 👌🏽👌🏽 but wish they had more color options,  so I custom wrapped the ps5 in camo red 🔥🔥  also made a video of it 🎬When people said “PS4 looks like 2020” when it first came out.. bruh the PS5 looks like 2030!!!😂Well, they said that the size is for better cooling. If that cooler actually works well (Not like ps4), I think that it's size actually worths it!Lol nice I think the differences are not that much between tthe two new consoles but it's more of the feel and exclusives coming along with them so either  console will have the same mechanics  at least to be mainLook really futuristic, definitely Next GenThey should've slapped a display port on it as well as the humi for people that use higher refresh monitors than 120Looks like a boss system ;-)  I'll be watching the new videos when you get them uploadedIt is simply amazing just how similar your introduction shot is compared to those of a couple of other well known teck channels? It is as if everyone is being directed by some unseen force.Can we all forget the hate for today and remember how much of an OG Ali A is, like about 8 years ago he unboxed the ps4 in a single room where he lived in, now he has a whole house and has come a long way💯Man, it looks so clean.  To be honest it looks like an alienware pcit looks so cool. like a black wifi router with two pieces of blank white paper attached lol. but still is pretty cool. Ali-A, ur a g. love u man.Loving it mate, can’t wait for it 😃I love the background music that started when he opened the cardboard box it really speaks to me - a man of culture.Looks beautiful! I wish I had it right now!When ever Ali a posts a unboxing video, I would never press to watch as I would easily get jealous!!I still remember your PS4 unboxing. Time flies man.A true gamer can only give the best unboxing of the ps5.Yes Ali always uploads a banger🔥🔥🔥the PS5 looks stunning!!!!! great video ALI-AEvery YouTube who got the PS5: I'm not allowed to show you game play just yet
Ali: SO HERE'S THE GAME PLAY GUYSi actually love the way it looks even if it does look like a wifi routerAli a is so consistent man I love u man💯❤️Fact: Front of the PS5 shape is a “V” wich represents “5” in PS5.How times fly, it feels just like yesterday when Ali A unboxed the Playstation 4Tbh I was never a fan of PlayStation I always was with the Xbox people. But I’ve got to hand it to Sony. The new design for the PS5 is insane. I love the whole design and everythingWhen Ali a stood up it reminded me of his floss and best mates 😂😂😂😂
Edit:  Thanks for 78 likes!!! Thats my most ever!!!!!!!I think there is no point in getting the disc version it might be my opinion but if the digital one is £100 cheaper I’d rather get that one as I would probably lose or scratch the discI cant even pre orders one and my man already has one. Props to you Alia!The Ultimate Next Generation console 😍🔥🔥🔥It looks so amazing. I can’t wait to get it🥺825 GB
Call of Duty: “I’ll be taking that"Ali A: Notice the rip on the box.

Ali A: I hope it’s still there!i am so hyped like i cant even express it! a new playstation! i love everything about it and i saw its way better that the ps4 but ofc i have to play both to confirm that but still im hyped!Can’t wait for the ps5 to drop been counting down the days till it releases !!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️Ali-A would be one of the first people to get a PS5 😂I wonder how they implement the rtx 3090 (because that is 8k resolution) into a console instead of a gaming pc.I have pre ordered my ps5. I can not wait to receive it. Great video 👍Very happy for you im so excited that a Great guy like u gets access earlyThey say jealousy will destroy a man now I understand.
I'm still glad Ali got it to bring the content in
Much love and envyI'm curious to know what the dualsense controller will feel with claw playersFinally someone does a gameplay of it :DI love the engineering behind the design of the SeriesX wayyyyyy better than the design of the PS5.I really want Sony to make a weighted version of the Ps5 controllerImagine if somebody got a PS4 in 2020 and a week later they release the PS5.Most people are going to need to upgrade their TV/Monitor to get the most out of it, just keep that in mind.man i remember being in the 6th grade watching ali unbox the ps4. crazy stuff man7 years ago
le 11 year old me watches Ali unbox the ps4

today 
le 18 year old me watching Ali unbox the ps5

great to see how far he's gotCongratulations on getting the ps5 early!You are so lucky Ali I won’t be able to afford one lol 😂 never mind it looks sooooooooooooooioo sick lol9:41

PS5 controller: What’s Poppin

Xbox One controller: Don’t mind me just watchingThe ps5 looks absolute fire 🔥I love it
Different colour controllers different coloured external plates.... USB C .....
Interally cleanable....
Better controller batteries...

The list goes on "LOVE IT"......😍😍😍👍👍👍The controller looks pretty cool but the series x takes the number one place with the console its self..The people who let you get the ps5 are super niceThe future of gaming is hereWho else thought he was capping and then saw the rest of the vid and was surprisedAlia came through with the unboxing AND the gameplay!Theory:Xbox and PS might be teaming up because their consoles were anounced at around the same time! And also I think they have the same frames!I like the look. Reminds me of Storm trooper Armour.Wow Ali-A has 17.4 million subscribers now? I used to follow him when he started doing his pokemon-go videos and stopped after that craze died down. Nice to see him doing well :)is that the way it sits 8:49 with the hard disk drive face downward to the ground or is that how he placed it? I prefer it to aim up.I’m glad you got yours early. Hopefully I will have mine secure by 2024 :/sounds like an amazing consoleWow it looks way cooler on a desk and tables than on a white background its so cool im so hypedI can't wait to get my hands on mine on the 12th. I got my charging station for the ps5 today.Can't wait for the PS5 I'm definitely gonna get it.Have you tried running games on it at 120hz on 1440p. Is it possible to opt out of 4k if you prefer the higher refresh rate and only got a panel with hdmi 2.0?Nobody:
Viewers: Thinking they will get to watch gameplayHave the ps5 on pre order can't wait to play. It looks amazingAli's got himself the new Sony internet router 👏🏻It bothers me that the shiny black plastic doesn't match the much nicer matte black on the controller.  Why, Sony, why??The design is flawlessFor it to be harder to push down with the adaptive controls won’t that damage the muscles in you fingers"the PlayStation can be layed flat"

Xbox owners:
"Wow incredible!"How were the FPS? Was it a solid 30FPS experienceMy question is what are the ps5 scuf controllers going to look likeI still can’t believe they put  the disc drive that way lolFinally a ps5 unboxing thanks Ali great vid 👍😀The design is so sicktheRadBrad: Microsoft gave me early Xbox series x.

Ali-a: Sony gave me early PS5.

I was waiting for that kind of video.Hope fully we get a ps5 SLIM (I don’t have enough space for a big console like that)I can’t wait to get the ps5 💯💯IM SO HYPED FOR PS5!!! I think what were going to do is sell my ps4 for the ps5 if we can but I got my ps4 around April 2016 so it’s been a whileDownload Monster Legends now and get this special reward for free until September 26th! 
https://monsterlegends.onelink.me/QSYm/SilverThe effort is insane! Respect 📈📈📈Next video: *1,000 DAYS AS A SHAPESHIFTER*I love how you introduce all of these new mods, structures and just overall how thoroughly you explain all of these-😭✋🏻💞 I appreciate it especially since it keeps me paying attention instead of spacing out all the time :,>The effort put in this video man. Not only did he actually take the effort to make a sequel, he also asked other Minecrafters to voice out different characters like one I remember PrestonPlayz voicing out the lava wizard. The respect.This series is so unique, and entertaining, you can tell that there was a LOT of effort put into this video and the mod itself, this deserves to be watched on my tv while eating food.This editor needs an award. The background music syncing with the block breaking was crazy. Love the vids man keep it up <3What is this insane quality content man, I have not seen anything like this in a long time and I only watched 2 minutes. The part where the Wizard Villager was given voicelines (even if just outside the game) blew my mind.usually the problem with these kinds of videos is that they are always the same thing over and over, but this is so unique on all the different morphs its so addicting to watch you progress and get different morphs with different abilities and traits. amazingly made + the bonus of it being 40 minutes long, amazing contentSilver's videos' skits are very fun and unique. Respect!I love how much effort is put into these videos. I also appreciate hoe all these YouTubers are helping eachother in different videos to grow together. Great teamwork and you did a great job making this video guys!So  xNesterio being a wizard is apparently  Canon.i love the way when he use maps to reveal the sponsors hahaha LOVE ITI’m not sure how people would dislike these videos. Like bruh, they have a player that makes things fun and explains things better than most other youtubers AND he has quite a lot of know youtubers who are GREAT voice actors. I would’ve subbed if I found him earlier.This should be a legit real thing in mind craft in its next update. And maybe make the Minecraft world more like a copy of the earth, but with the usual Minecraft bioms. Oh and the program mod would also be epic.This was a crazy good video, so worth the wait!
It's insane how much you've grown as a content creator since your UHC days.
Looking forward to the next 100 days! :DYou should start uploading more, your videos are insane.great video and editing was flawless, just thought I should mention that efficiency 5 haste 2 can instamine stoneYou can tell how much time goes into these vids, they're awesome!I love the transition near the end foreshadowing the custom end 100 days video.I love listing to your videos! Nice story telling!This must've taken forever, you needed the mods, the playing the game, the voiceovers, the editing.
nice job silver, you have improved a lot from your skyblock videos on your speedsilver channel26:00
Kinda fishy that you always break the spawners but this time you didn't and magicly you needed those spawners for those soulsThe effort and quality of these videos are insane!i love how he got other youtubes to talk for the WizardsThis was so well edited! Worth the time!! I'm excited to see what is next! ✨Can we just appreciate how the intro was awesomethe ONLY things that I would want to add to ur base are areas dedicated to the dimensions and other small things like a max tier beacon.  Other than those inconsequential nitpickslove how much effort he put inLove that you added the Korok forest music in from Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.The effort put in both videos i wish i could put as much effort in my school projects 
This is truly cool and amazing, love that you decided to make it not just a 100 days video but also add lorethe first vid i watched on this channel was the surviving 100 days in the modded end.. and I got instantly hooked! keep up the good workAs always super impressed by the quality. Absolutely stunning!!Love it when the wizards were youtubers also love it how he defeat so many custom bossesYou should make some farms with the spawners maybe at 300 days, you can get so much loot with them farmsSilver: I’m not the best at building
Also silver: builds insane mountain houseThe Nether Gauntlet is literally the Dark version of the Eyerock boss from Super Mario 64.Let’s talk about how at the 20 second diamond mining Timelapse he synced the noise of mining diamonds to the songSheeesh the ending was so good and seriously both these 200 days and the next 100 days will be the best videos I have ever seen.
Also needed to add this, the amount of effort required to make a video this interesting is insane, I really hope you get even more views than beforeTHE  EFFORT IS  INSANE! RESPECT“Definitely not the best builder ever” Him building something better than I ever haveSo much good videos bro keep up the good work and you'll hit your goal in no timeThe effort is insane, now this is how you make content.I like how silver accidentally called the ocean wizard “Nestor”.. lolI love how he get all the creatures to shape shifts for the final boss just to fight it using monkyThis is literally Silver getting infinity stones for a staffI loved the 100 days one . I like this one too.I love how you timed the diamond mining perfectly with the song at 33:54 and 38:22, it just sounds so good!Lowkey living as a shapeshifter would be so useful nglThe shape-shifting was really cool.Bro! The editing in these videos are fire! 🔥 these videos are so entertaining!Petition for Silver to Make an smp with lots of mods and plugins with all the people who have appeared in his videos and other Minecraft youtubers27:14
Ah yes. *Cave Stone for the Cave Orb.*It’s amazing to see how Silver went from normal UHC videos to this glad to see itWow the way he bulit up ythe story to lead to the next vid is insane. Props to u SilverYour editing skills is so good manIs it only me or anyone else also wants to see thins turn into at least a 1000 day series 🤗Please do continue this shape shifter series! Keep up the good work! 👍🏻How did you edit this video it's very impressivetip: you can put glass panes on top of the beacon to make it look like the beacon beam is naturally orange. You can also put different colors one on top of another to make it periodically change the higher it goes.I often find myself wondering how to edit something or struggling to get the result I want, please tell me what editor you use, that would be greatly appreciated.This went from a 100 day series to a voice acted quest series. Awesome!I have been watching your videos and your sooo cool, and I subbed at this one. Thx for helping me with my anxietyThese are the types of videos that got me into making michinimas. Awesome work!I liked how u used the Pokemon theme for choosing ur shapeshifts, fittingI love how he played pokemon music when he had to choose his shapeshifts in the beginning.
Anyways, good video. I liked itYo what an insane video, Silver the effort and editing is like a god tier documentary, only hope you post videos more frequently. But srsly you deserve more subs and views...I love how we are not gonna notice his hearts are from normal modeHey man, I can't believe you've already reached a million and a half subscribers! That's insane! I swear it wasn't all that long ago that you had only like 20,000 or so!"and the sea dragon"
*flashbacks to my wings of fire phase*I think for your next episode, you could adapt the house and consider all the shapeshifts you have. For example. make a room only accessible for a shark, one for an oranguntan etc!






EDIT: Should've waited for the end of the video to say that...When the legend is back, not only does he change his life, he changes the lives of millionsi realised you couldve just used an diamond axe with the tiger morph.Next video should be 200 days at the infinite ice spike biome.
Not modified. It's seems  impossible because only 2 structures spawns in biome. Mineshaft , only large source of wood, and stronghold.I love how the lava wizard is just Preston talkingi just love that he got preston to voice lava wizardI like how he got other YouTubers to do the voice of the wizardsPetition for silver to make a part three and making this a series. Lolthe pokemon theme playing while you pick your mobs was amazingI'm proud of you for quitting hypixel skyblock/uhc, and going to Minecraft mods,
I'm glad to see u be successful, good luck for the rest of your life! 
I'm always happy for the choices u make. as a person who is subscribed for a long time.you know it's a good day when silver uploads38:50 hey silver you are probably not gonna see this, but use a glass pane instead of a block , it still colours the beam but you can’t see the glassHey, do you edit in Premiere, Vegas, or something else?Watched this like a billion times by now cuz it is so addicting XDsilver:has the most powerful shapeshifts to use against the obsidilith
also silver:mmmm monkeySilver: I’m not the best at building
Me: I can’t even build something that good in creativeI like how Preston played the lava wizard, it suits him.You can imagine that if you support this dude, he will give you a actuall mod of shapeshifterlove how when he's selecting his 7 shapeshifts theirs pokemon music in the backgroundquestion: how did you get so many different people like Preston and xNestorio to voice the wizards?wow I just binged watched both videos and I must say it’s very addicting. Cant wait for the next 100 days!17:30 is it just me or is that health bar a bit less then half and then it diedpillager boss : its over silver, ive got the high ground!
